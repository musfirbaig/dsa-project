tried a different one .\nThis time , the word was offered after I answered several questions .\nNo question was too personal , but each of them did have me reflect on life .\nLife \u2019 s been\u2026a lot .\nIt \u2019 s been difficult .\nIt \u2019 s been exhausting .\nBut , it \u2019 s also been filled with blessings , extra family time , and some moments of peace .\nAnother Christian-based website , I liked this word that was generated for me also !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that activity is to pick a word that drags you down , though .\nThe word is meant to inspire throughout the year .\nEven though I can get super tired on some of our busiest days , I don \u2019 t need any visual reminders that I am .\nThe goal of picking the word is meant to be something you strive to achieve .\nIt \u2019 s supposed to be an inspiration and maybe a guide for you if you \u2019 ve fallen off a path you \u2019 d set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word may be difficult , so some people have set up word generators on their websites that will randomly chose a word for you .\nSince I \u2019 ve never done this before , while the kids were all sleeping in on New Year \u2019 s Day I thought I \u2019 d give it a whirl .\nI never jumped on the bandwagon to make vision boards or do any sort of journaling .\nThose are creative avenues people have used to focus on their goals and dreams .\nTo me , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough work to do on a day-to-day basis trying to keep up with my kids .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong , I do dream and I do have some great goals .\nI \u2019 ll talk about them and write them down , but I don \u2019 t have a separate book or wall space where I display those .\nI love that others have the time and creativity to keep up with those activities .\nI love that they will come up with new goals and dreams , oftentimes using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set or restart something .\nWhen I read somewhere that some people choose a word to focus on when the New Year begins , I thought that might be more my speed .\nHow many times have I been empowered by our community of doers and believers ?\nSo many times !\nIt \u2019 s because of you and your stories that have given me the voice to tell others our story .\nBoth of those word generators were really neat to use , but I wanted to see what a secular/non-Christian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI found this completely random webpage and thought that their word for me was good , too !\nIf there \u2019 s one word that describes what it is that I do for those whom I love , that word right there truly does describe it .\nI am devoted to my family .\nI am devoted to our community .\nI am devoted to living a life God has asked me to live , even if some of my life is overwhelming and exhausting .\nMore than just giving me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to reflect on some of the past during this activity .\nThe past can be a dangerous place .\nDo I really want to linger there ?\nI \u2019 ve shared that yes , sometimes to leap to the future , you need that past .\nTo know what you don \u2019 t want in life now , you must know what didn \u2019 t work before .\nIt \u2019 s a launching point .\nThat \u2019 s where that Empowered word pick was so perfect : I am empowered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future .\nI \u2019 m the least arts and crafty person I know .\nI \u2019 m the last one to follow all the rules , and I \u2019 m also the best at procrastinating .\nThis little activity was something I didn \u2019 t need to do ( if you saw the piles of files on my desk , you \u2019 d absolutely agree ) , but I did need a little inspiration as I tippy toed into the New Year and found it .\nIf you \u2019 ve never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes to yourself today , I \u2019 d suggest you try it .\nIf you need more than just one word , you \u2019 re in luck .\nI even saw a phrase generator .\nIf you don \u2019 t want to use the internet , you don \u2019 t have to .\nPeople pick their own word , or they pray or meditate on a word using it as their theme for the year .\nIf a year is too long of a time to keep that one word in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or phrase for just a day .\nIf a day is too much , which is can be for me sometimes , go hour-by-hour .\nOne day at a time and with one foot in front of the other , I \u2019 m praying for success for each of us as we embark on the year ahead .\nCathy Jameson is a Contributing Editor for Age of Autism

@ ever vigilant .\nWe switched Ronan 's seizure meds last week .\nHe began having seizures every other day which is highly unusual for him .\nStoopid generic meds !\nAfter many emails , phone calls ,

had seizures in the past when he 's on generic meds .\nI was able to get an emergency 3-day supply tonight , but to get the right meds for him can you write a script that says Dispense Name Brand Only please ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the other problems we encountered .\nAlso , Ronan 's other insurance is saying that the cost of the meds exceeds the maximum allowable charge .\nI do n't know who to

especially when the next issue happened .\nRonan was due to receive a month \u2019 s supply of one of the seizure drugs .\nInstead , the pharmacy filled the order with generic drugs he never should have received .\nHow did I not take the advice I \u2019 ve given to several parents over the years ?\nIf you do opt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I strongly encourage you to consider is to get Name Brand Only medication .\nThe doctor needs to write that in the medical file and on the prescription itself .\nBut I knew the current prescription was for Name Brand Only .\nNo exceptions !\nWhat happened ?\nWhen I asked why Ronan got this order and not the one he always gets , the pharmacy technician told me that the doctor authorized it .\nWith one quick call to our neurology nurses \u2019 line , I proved that that information he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only making mistakes , but now they \u2019 re lying to me ?\n!\nPointing out that potentially grave mistake , I asked for whatever name brand they had in stock .\nSince it \u2019 s a special order drug , I only got half the order .\nI promised myself , and Ronan , that I \u2019 d switch pharmacies as soon as the rest of the order was available .\nNo way would I allow them to fill another prescription after the errors they were making .\nOver the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating when the remaining boxes would be ready for pick up .\nHalf of the correct refill is ready .\nThat \u2019 s a little bit of relief but not good enough .\nBetter news\u2026reinforcements have arrived in the form of a neuro nurse named Kathryn ( she may spell her name wrong J but we are now kindred spirits as we share the same name and the same fight ) .\nMore on the story later after I get the full prescription in my hands\u2026 A week later , I finally got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called the store to find out what was going on .\nThe meds were promised , then they weren \u2019 t .\nAs had happened previously , my call was immediately put on hold .\nI \u2019 d average 45-minute hold times each time I called with no one ever picking up when I needed them to .\nThe call would be dropped by the phone system , or I \u2019 d hang up and try to get through again .\nWhile still on hold , I decided I \u2019 d drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the store waiting to speak to someone , I could hear , \u201c One pharmacy call , two pharmacy calls , three pharmacy calls\u2026four pharmacy calls \u201d over the PA system .\nWhen it was my turn to approach the counter , I showed the pharmacist that I was still on hold .\n46 minutes and counting .\nAbout to run out of the meds , I said , \u201c You never pick up the phone , you don \u2019 t open the drive-thru window anymore , you close early , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription correctly .\nWhat is going on here ?\n?\n\u201d The explanation I got was that they are understaffed and that a \u201c floater \u201d , someone filling in from another pharmacy group , was supposed to fill the prescription at 11am .\nShe did not .\nThere were tears ( again ) for the mistakes that ( continued ) to be made by them .\nI knew they couldn \u2019 t fill the full order correctly .\nThey couldn \u2019 t even fill half the order correctly .\nI was beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for nurses and a much more professional pharmacy outfit who saw the problem and who quickly offered to help fix it .\nI \u2019 m still nervous about a few things , but I \u2019 m giving it to God ( and to the specialty pharmacy now ) .\nThanks for the prayers , especially to anyone who kept this particular intention on the back burner\u2026it shouldn \u2019 t have taken weeks to resolve , but it did .\nIn the meantime , our doctor reached out .\n\u201c Hey , Cathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sent me after hours , \u201c I see you \u2019 ve called the clinic a few times .\nCan I do anything for you ?\n\u201d With these sorts of issues , I generally talk to her nurses .\nThey are gems , truly , and can help me pretty quickly .\nWhen they can \u2019 t help , they \u2019 ll consult with the doctor and get back to me with the information I need .\nI \u2019 m glad for the neurologist \u2019 s desire to help this time .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ronan \u2019 s prescriptions were in another pharmacy database .\nBefore he \u2019 d need them again , they were approved by insurance .\nAnd before the current script would run out , the new \u2013 and correct order was on the way to us .\nIt was a relief to get the correct medication .\nGoing forward , I \u2019 ll pray that each refill is the right refill and that it arrives at the right time .\nThe new pharmacy simply did what I expect them to do : fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription CVS failed to fill , I \u2019 d shared this with those I \u2019 d asked to pray with me .\nBesides filling meds correctly , the place I want to use instead answers their phone , they do their one job , and they do it well .\nBefore I ditched them , I \u2019 d had to pop into the CVS store more than I expected to .\nOn every occasion , the line for the pharmacy was long , like snake around several aisles long .\nNot only would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the vaccination line be crowded .\nAt one point , when I raced back to the store to try to resolve one of the medication issues , it was nearing 9pm .\nSeveral people were behind me at the consultation counter .\nEven more people were lingering in the area after checking in on the vaccination app .\nFeeling rushed , the pharmacist apologized for the mistake and said he \u2019 d look into the issue for me .\nThen , while pointing at me , the pharmacist told the cashier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my last Rx customer .\nI need to start doing the vaccines next.\n\u201d The COVID vaccines , \u201c \u2026and 15 others we offer\u2026 \u201d their message would continuously say when I sat on the hold line for all those hours , are now the priority .\nThis pharmacy doesn \u2019 t just fill medications anymore .\nThey \u2019 ve become a vaccine center .\nIn offering vaccines , they \u2019 re being pulled in two different directions .\nCall them enterprising , greedy , foolish fools or all three \u2013 based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in over their heads trying to balance both .\nIt \u2019 s too much .\nNo wonder mistakes are being made !\nI have two pharmacists admitting on record that mistakes were made and will see to following up on that .\nI also have on record our doctor and our nurses sharing that they never want me to go through something like this again .\nI really thought things were going better than okay as I filled Ronan \u2019 s prescriptions each month .\nWhat a wakeup call these last few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect reminder for me that no matter what I \u2019 m doing for my children , I must remember to stay ever vigilant .\nCathy Jameson is a Contributing

Kennedy Jr.", "content": "Dr. Meryl Nass had this to say about these studies , \u201c The purpose seemed , very clearly , to poison the patients and blame the deaths on HCQ.\n\u201d ( The correct protocol is to give HCQ , zinc , and Zithromax at a dosage that is safe and effective early in the disease before the patients are critically ill .\nThese studies used borderline lethal doses of HCQ in critically ill patients and did not use zinc and Zithromax .\nThe intent of these studies was to deliberately make HCQ appear ineffective and dangerous . )\nMore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill Gates , and WHO financed a cadre of research mercenaries to concoct a series of nearly 20 studies all employing fraudulent protocols deliberately designed to discredit HCQ as unsafe .\nInstead of using the standard treatment dose of 400 mg/day , the 17 WHO studies administered a borderline lethal daily dose starting with 2,400 mg on Day 1 and using 800 mg/day thereafter.\n\u201d On page 19 , Kennedy explains that \u201c Dr .\nFauci led an effort to deliberately derail America \u2019 s access to lifesaving drugs and medicines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and dramatically shortened the pandemic\u2026From the outset , HCQ and other therapeutics posed an existential threat to Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates \u2019 $ 48 billion COVID vaccine project , and particularly to their vanity drug Remdesivir , in which Gates has a large stake .\nOn page 21 there is more information on HCQ : \u201c Some 200 peer-reviewed studies ( C19Study.com ) by government and independent researchers deem HCQ safe and effective against Coronavirus , especially when taken prophylactically or when in the initial stages of illness along with zinc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective and cheap drugs had to be suppressed in order to sell more vaccines and Remdesivir . )\nOn page 8 , Dr Peter McCullough , MD observes that \u201c We could have dramatically reduced COVID fatalities and hospitalizations using early treatment protocols and repurposed drugs including ivermectin ( IVM ) and hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) and many , many others\u2026Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies now show that early treatment could have averted some 80 percent of deaths attributed to COVID\u2026but for Dr. Fauci \u2019 s hard-headed tunnel vision on new vaccines and Remdesivir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of cheap and highly effective drugs was not only ignored but was aggressively suppressed . )\nThis quote is from page XV of the introduction .\nKennedy explains : \u201c Regulatory capture is the process by which the regulator becomes beholden to the industry it \u2019 s meant to regulate ... From the moment of my reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate in 2005 , I was astonished to realize that the pervasive web of deep financial entanglements between Pharma and the government health agencies had put regulatory capture on steroids.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other regulators no longer protect the people from rapacious pharma corporations .\nThey now protect these corporations from the people . )\nBest-selling author James Howard Kunstler ( The Long Emergency and several other books ) describes The Real Anthony Fauci as \u201c A massive book about Fauci \u2019 s unholy career at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a virtual prosecution manual , meticulously annotated , that will be used in countless lawsuits against Dr. Fauci , his colleagues who outlive him , and the many agencies and NGOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these well-known perps.\n\u201d ( Is this derogatory quote justified ?\nRead on . )\nThis article will cover highlights from the first 100 pages of this 445-page book .\nFuture articles will cover the rest .\nThe plan is to list page numbers so those who have the book can read more about each nugget and look up the references if they want more information .\nMy comments will appear in parenthesis .\nOn page 29 , Kennedy describes these studies : \u201c Both studies in these respected publications relied on data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois based medical education company that claimed to somehow control an extraordinary global database boasting access to medical information from 96,000 patients in more than 600 hospitals \u2026 The Lancet article portrayed HCQ as ineffective and dangerous \u2026 Three European nations immediately banned use of HCQ , and others followed within weeks.\n\u201d ( The Surgisphere data was fraudulently conjured up from thin air . )\nMore on page 30 : \u201c Both The Lancet and NEJM finally withdrew their studies in shame \u2026 To date neither the authors nor the journals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish the most momentous fraud in the history of scientific publishing \u2026The capacity of their Pharma overlords to strong-arm the world \u2019 s top two medical journals into condoning deadly research and to simultaneously publish blatantly fraudulent articles in the middle of a pandemic , attests to the cartel \u2019 s breathtaking power and ruthlessness \u2026 The headline of a comprehensive expose \u2019 in the British newspaper \u201c The Guardian \u201d expressed the global shock among the scientific community of the rank corruption by scientific publishing \u2019 s most formidable pillars : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest retractions in modern history .\nHow could this happen ?\n\u201d The Guardian writers openly accused The Lancet of promoting fraud .\n\u201c The sheer number and magnitude of the things that went wrong or missing are too enormous to attribute to mere incompetence \u2026 What \u2019 s incredible is that the editors of these esteemed journals still have a job.\n\u201d Meanwhile in Other Countries On page 32 and 33 , Kennedy describes what was happening in other countries regarding HCQ : \u201c In compliance with the WHO recommendation , Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about two weeks into the ban , Switzerland \u2019 s death rates tripled , for about 15 days , until Switzerland reintroduced HCQ .\nCOVID deaths then fell back to their baseline .\nSwitzerland \u2019 s \u201c natural experiment \u201d had provided yet another potent argument for HCQ \u2026 A meta-review of 58 observational studies by physician researchers in Spain , Italy , France , and Saudi Arabia found that HCQ dramatically reduced mortality from COVID , while additional articles by doctors in Turkey , Canada , and the US found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAndrew Schlafly ( engineer and lawyer ) observed that , \u201c The mortality rate from COVID-19 in countries that allow access to HCQ is only one-tenth the mortality rate in countries where there is interference with this medication , such as the United States \u2026 In some areas of Central America , officials are even going door to door to distribute HCQ \u2026 these countries have been successful in limiting the mortality from COVID-19 to only a fraction of what it is in wealthier countries.\n\u201d On page 37 , Kennedy covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the summer of 2020 , front-line physicians had discovered another COVID remedy that equaled HCQ in its staggering , life-saving efficacy .\nFive years earlier , two Merck scientists won the Nobel Prize for developing IVM , a drug with unprecedented firepower against a wide range of human parasites , including roundworm , hookworm , river blindness , and lymphatic filariasis .\nThat salute was the Nobel Committee \u2019 s only award to an infectious disease medication in 60 years .\nFDA approved IVM as safe and effective for human use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HCQ ) on its inventory of \u201c essential medicines \u201d \u2026 Millions of people have consumed billions of IVM doses as an anti-parasitic , with minimal side effects \u201d On page 38 , the effectiveness of IVM in preventing COVID-19 is covered : \u201c In Argentina , for example , in the summer of 2020 , Dr. Hector Carvallo conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial of IVM as a preventive , finding 100 percent efficacy against COVID-19 .\nCarvallo \u2019 s team found no infections in 788 workers who took weekly IVM prophylaxis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become ill with COVID-19.\n\u201d As the U.S. Restricts IVM , Other Countries Are Increasing Its Use On pages 42 and 43 , the contrast in the use of IVM in other countries compared to the U.S. is presented : \u201c Today , as Dr. Fauci moves the U.S. to eliminate all use of IVM , other countries are using more of it .\nIn February 2021 , the head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association held a press conference to call for adding IVM to its outpatient treatment protocol .\nSeveral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of essential medications to treat COVID-19 .\nIndonesia \u2019 s government not only authorized the use of the drug but also created a website showing real-time availability \u2026 El Salvador distributes IVM for free to all of its citizens .\nNations where residents have easy access to IVM invariably see immediate and dramatic declines in COVID deaths .\nHospitals in Indonesia started using IVM on July 22 , 2021 .\nBy the first week of August , cases and deaths were plummeting \u2026 New Delhi , India was experiencing a COVID epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of Delhi cases by distributing IVM .\nOn pages 52 and 53 , Dr. Lawrie began by endorsing the miraculous efficacy of IVM : \u201c Had IVM been employed in 2020 when medical colleagues around the world first alerted the authorities to its efficacy , millions of lives could have been saved , and the pandemic with all its associated suffering and loss brought to a rapid and timely end \u2026 The story of IVM has highlighted that we are at a remarkable juncture in medical history .\nThe tools that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematically undermined by relentless disinformation stemming from corporate greed .\nThe story of IVM shows that we as a public have misplaced our trust in the authorities and have underestimated the extent to which money and power corrupts \u2026 Dr. Lawrie called out the corruption of modern medicine by Big Pharma and other interests and attributed the barbaric suppression of IVM to the single-minded obsession with more profitable vaccines.\n\u201d IVM Works Great/Can \u2019 t Have That/Got to Do Something Dr. Pierre Kory is the former Chief of the Critical Care Service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Support Center at the University of Wisconsin .\nOn page 54 , his testimony before the Senate and what happened next will shock you .\n\u201c When Dr. Kory \u2019 s explosive December 8 , 2020 Senate testimony describing the peer-reviewed science supporting IVM went viral , prescriptions for IVM from U.S. doctors exploded .\nAmericans were getting legitimate prescriptions filled at pharmacies , up to 88,000 scripts in a single week .\nThe truth of the drug \u2019 s benefits was going viral , and the last thing Dr. Fauci et al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID .\nSomething needed to be done .\nThe government moved aggressively to block its use \u2026 You Tube soon scrubbed Kory \u2019 s video and Facebook blocked him .\nThen in March 2021 the U.S. FDA , the European Medical Association ( EMA ) , and the WHO issued statements advising against the use of IVM for COVID-19 \u2026 On July 18 , 2021 a front-page Wall Street Journal headline asked , \u201c Why is the FDA Attacking a Safe , Effective Drug ?\n\u201d On August 16 , 2021 , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CDC ordered doctors to stop prescribing IVM .\n( Is it clear yet ? )\nOn pages 63-70 : \u201c Anthony Fauci needed to use all his moxie and all his esoteric maneuvers mastered during his half-century at NIH , to win FDA \u2019 s approval for his vanity drug , Remdesivir .\nRemdesivir has no clinical efficacy against COVID-19 according to every legitimate study .\nWorse , it is deadly poisonous and expensive , an expensive poison at $ 3,000 per treatment \u2026 Many doctors believe our country \u2019 s record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to widespread use of remdesivir in 2020 .\nWe had the most deaths worldwide says Dr. Ryan Cole .\nIt is a haunting question : How many of these Americans were remdesivir casualties ?\nDr. Peter McCullough gives us a stark and clear summary : Remdesivir has two problems .\nFirst , it doesn \u2019 t work .\nSecond , it is toxic and its kills people.\n\u201d VAERS stands for Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System .\nOn page 72 and 73 : \u201c Dr .\nFauci stubbornly refused to fix VAERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injuries \u2026 A 2010 HHS study concluded that VAERS detects fewer that 1 percent of vaccine injuries .\nPut another way , VAERS misses OVER 99 percent of vaccine injuries , thereby lending the illusion of safety to even the deadliest inoculations .\nIn 2010 , the federal Agency for Health Care Research Quality ( AHRQ ) designed and field-tested a state-of-the-art machine-counting system as an efficient alternative to VAERS .\nBy testing the system for several years on the Harvard Pilgrim HMO , AHRQ proved that it could capture most vaccine injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system to all remaining HMOs , but after seeing the AHRQ \u2019 s frightening results- vaccines were causing serious injuries in 1 of every 40 recipients- CDC killed the project and stowed the new system on a dusty shelf.\n\u201d ( Which entities benefit from drastic undercounting of vaccine injuries and deaths ? )\nOn page 87 and 88 : \u201c Despite CDC \u2019 s efforts to hide the carnage in the U.S. , even the dysfunctional VAERS system has recorded unprecedented waves of documented deaths following COVID vaccines \u2026 Health workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past thirty-two years , yet in just eight months , the COVID vaccines have injured and killed far more Americans than all other vaccines combined over three decades.\n\u201d ( Read this paragraph again and try to take in this shocking truth . )\nThis article presents only a tiny fraction of the enormously important information in the first 100 pages of Kennedy \u2019 s book .\nStay tuned for the nuggets in the next 100

@ when he was triaged .\nA pro at sitting still when nurses take his temperature , blood pressure , and check his heart rate , I was grateful for his cooperation .\nThe nasal swab , based on the symptoms he presented with , was another story .\nIt took three people , me included , to convince Ronan to hold still and stay still for that invasive part of the exam .\nGreeted by the most peaceful wintry scene last Monday morning , our Christmas vacation was now extended at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , including my oldest who was home from college , my Mommy heart was happy .\nMy heart would go through a range of emotions over the next few days ...\nThe next day , every muscle would ache , and not just because of exertion , but I would be grateful that I spent those few hours shoveling out the truck .\nThe power would remain out all day and into Monday evening .\nWith the temperature dropping , I had to get the generator started .\nI 'd never done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book my husband typed up for me .\nTexting my husband to get step-by-step instructions , Ronan 's younger brother and I worked together to figure that out .\nWhen we finally started it , we warmed up the house , made a quick dinner , and recharged all the devices .\nI also made a cup of coffee to have in the morning .\nIt would be cold , but coffee is coffee no matter the temperature .\nWhen everyone was fed , I looked for a few updates on the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generator is on .\nCurious about what the world looked like beyond our street , I was floored at images I 'd see .\nIt looked like a bomb went off in our neighborhood .\nWorse , the electric company had yet to post when crews would be dispatched .\nThe roads were impassable for residents in many places , both inside and outside of our neighborhood .\nThat meant they were also impassable for utility trucks .\nToo many trees were still blocking too many roads .\nEven if Ronan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street earlier , she would n't have been able to drive down it .\nA very large tree landed across both lanes .\nNeighborhood maintenance crews had n't made their way toward our section yet , but once again strangers came to the rescue .\nUsing chainsaws to chop the decades-old tree up into smaller logs , strangers , and neighbors , moved them off the road into a snow pile .\nGetting the kids settled down for the night later was easy .\nRonan was also tired even though he 'd stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the heat being off most of the day .\nHe 'd had a slight fever Sunday evening but had perked up when the kids took turns watching him while I was outside .\nI would be grateful he 'd sleep through the night that night .\nCrawling under the covers , I looked forward to another day off the next day .\nNo way would all that snow melt away by Tuesday morning .\nWe 'd make the most of another snow day and enjoy some family time together .\nTuesday was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkway .\nKeep Ronan happy .\nShovel the rest of the driveway .\nCheck on Ronan .\nShovel some more .\nStay warm .\nWe still had no updates from the power company , but I was hopeful we 'd get the lights back on by evening .\nWe had to - the gas can only had about 2 gallons left .\nWe 'd turned the generator off during the day so that we could power up later `` just in case '' we faced another cold night .\nIt would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night would be one of the most frightening nights ever .\nBefore nightfall , we , like so many others did , ran out of gas for the generator .\nEven if I wanted to trek through the neighborhood to replenish our supply , gas stations had also run out of gas .\nThe kids were helpful and said it wasn \u2019 t too bad .\nWe \u2019 d gone a night without heat before , so they bundled up and grabbed as many blankets as they could find .\nThey also rearranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer in a warmer area of the house .\nRonan \u2019 s bedroom stayed surprisingly warm , so I settled him back in his bed after dinner .\nHe \u2019 d slept in very late that day and also napped for the few hours I was tending to things outside .\nSince the kids had gotten their fill of snow the day before , they stayed with Ronan while I got rock salt on the driveway , moved the broken limbs from a tree in our yard , and talked with a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us .\nI couldn \u2019 t sit still inside , so I stayed busy outside most of the afternoon .\nTemps would drop by nightfall , so everything that could be cleared needed to be cleared .\nMy neighbor stayed with me , chipping away at ice , shoveling more snow off of the tops of our vehicles , and also keeping me company .\nSatisfied that I could manage the rest by myself , she said goodbye .\nExhausted , more so than I thought I would be , I cleaned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside .\nAs it got colder outside , Ronan \u2019 s temperature started to rise .\n\u201c Mom , he \u2019 s warm , \u201d one of the kids shared with me as I walked in .\nHis fever was back .\nHis youngest sister had had one also on Sunday .\nNow , two days later , she , too , was starting to feel sluggish .\nI was also , but I chalked that up to all the work I \u2019 d been doing outside .\nIt would be an early-to-bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , we made a plan .\nSince fevers can bring on seizures for Ronan , I made sure to have his emergency meds with me in his room .\nI \u2019 d sleep in there with him to monitor his temperature .\nAdvice from my best friend had me bring the pulse oximeter with me also .\nI \u2019 d checked Ronan \u2019 s readings earlier that evening and saw some troubling numbers .\nOxygen was at 97 , not too alarming , but he \u2019 s a solid 99 kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I \u2019 d checked his resting heart rate , but I knew it had increased .\nSince we had no internet at that point , texts and calls to others fed us information - What is an average heart rate for a 19 year old ?\nWhat are signs/symptoms of pneumonia ?\nWhen do you need to seek emergency care for covid ?\nIt hadn \u2019 t dawned on me that this could be covid , but I wanted us to know what to look for .\nThe more I read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , boy .\nAnd oh , no .\nCould this be covid ?\nRonan can not tell us where it hurts or when it hurts , so we rely on signs and symptoms , several of which by Tuesday night he was fully displaying .\nTucking everyone in after saying family prayers , I continued to pray for Ronan .\nHe fell asleep instantly at 9pm .\nJarred awake at 3:23am , Ronan \u2019 s cough that started mid-afternoon Tuesday was pretty strong .\nUnable to clear the cough , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had gone away came back with a vengeance .\nThe heart rate that had been just slightly elevated was now incredibly high .\nGrabbing the pulse/ox monitor and the stethoscope , I watched and listened .\nThen I woke up the kids and put a plan into action .\n\u201c Kids , if Ronan begins to struggle , I \u2019 ll need to take him to the ER .\nI \u2019 ll bring Izzy .\nFiona , you \u2019 ll stay with the others , \u201d I told the kids before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick which kid would go with me and which ones would stay home .\nEach of them wanted to come with their brother , God bless them !\nWe hadn \u2019 t left the neighborhood yet , so I had no idea what to expect .\nI didn \u2019 t know it , but God knew that Izzy , who happened to walk the entire neighborhood Tuesday afternoon with friends , needed to come with me .\nFully awake and ready with our bags , at 3:55am she and I held Ronan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the icy driveway to the truck I \u2019 d shoveled out .\nThe tremors were a sure sign that things were definitely going from bad to worse for Ronan .\nIf the cough and high fever were not enough , the wildly high heart rate was also terrifying .\nSo was having to drive through the darkened neighborhood over the power lines that lay limp on the frozen ground .\nRelying on Izzy \u2019 s memory , I went against every rule in the driver \u2019 s ed book when we ventured away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nFeeling full of energy the afternoon before , she and some teens wanted to walk to one of the restaurants outside of the neighborhood Tuesday afternoon .\nI thought they were nuts , but teenagers like to do things tired adults do n't want to do , so I gave Izzy my blessing to go .\nIt was midday when they left .\nShe would stay out until sunset and be driven home by one of the dads of the kids .\nAlong the way during the day , the teens helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spending money to buy food if the restaurant was open .\nIt was , so the adventure was worth it .\nSo was the knowledge Izzy gained while traversing the few short miles to the main roads .\nWithout her with me when Ronan needed emergency medical attention in the middle of the night , I would not have been brave enough to keep going .\nSeveral times , I thought we should just turn around and go home .\nI prayed so hard in those moments , but Izzy \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head .\n`` Mom , when you go down Mrs. K 's street , remember the utility pole is down .\nYou ca n't go under this one , so turn right .\nBut you will have to go under another pole , '' she said confidently .\nWe only got one street away from ours when I had to reroute us .\nBacking up down the snowy street , there was no place to turn around until we were at the intersection again .\nIzzy asked if I could turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about it , but one false move and we \u2019 d land in a deep ditch opposite that cleared driveway .\nThe thought of that scared me so much .\nRonan would surely not make it if we got stuck .\nFeeling weak , even though my heart was racing with adrenaline , I said it would be safer to back up along the dark road .\nTurning around , I snaked our way at less than 10 mph and approached the next intersection .\n`` Okay , mom , '' my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said we walked all over this place earlier ?\nYou 're going to have to trust me when I say go over them .\nMom .\nDId you hear me ?\nYou have to go over them ... '' It was pitch black , darker than dark with hundreds of branches hanging lower than usual under the weight of significant amounts of snow .\nOur neighborhood is a settled one , with thousands of trees lining the main streets , the side streets and people \u2019 s yards .\nSounding like shotguns going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large branches snapped one after another and came crashing to the ground even after the snowstorm had ended .\nEvidence of that lay all about us .\nRattling off instructions again , I listened to Izzy say , `` Start slowing down now , stay as far to the right as you can ... and ... you ca n't see it yet , but go a little more to the right and go wide ... now ! ''\nHoly crap !\nI 'd already been saying a string of Hail Mary prayers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud .\n\u201c HAIL MARY , FULL OF GRACE ... dear Lord , Izzy !\nThat 's the power line !\n! ''\nI yelled trying to slow down .\n`` MOM !\n\u201d Izzy raised her voice at me , \u201c GO , you need to keep going , just go wide and stay to the right , even when you turn.\n\u201d I never advocate for a child yelling at their parents , but had she not , we never would have made it around that area safely .\nTrusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said while driving down the hill .\nI could just make out the wires above us as I went under them .\nOn a straightaway for another quarter mile , I switched to the Guardian Angel prayer .\nImagining Ronan 's Guardian Angel guiding us , traveling with us , keeping an ever vigilant eye on him and on whatever lay ahead of us , I kept going .\nEyes wide open and taking in the storm destruction everywhere I looked , Izzy said , `` Mom , remember I said you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nWell , the next set is approaching . ''\nI asked , `` Honey , how many times am I going to go over these things ?\n? ''\nWithout hesitation , she said , `` Three .\nKeep going , the next one is right ... .now .\nGO , keep going , you can do this , Mom .\nYou just need to trust me .\nThe power is off , remember .\nI saw so many cars and people walking over them today .\nJust keep going . ''\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other teens took on their walk early , but they went on both main roads and many of the side roads .\nShe knew where the dangerous pockets were .\n`` Izzy , I 'm so nervous .\nI 've never been this nervous to drive before ! ''\nI admitted to my 15 year old .\n`` Mom , you 've got this .\nPlus , Ronan needs you to stay calm and keep driving . ''\nShe was right .\nRonan was tanking again .\nI could have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadways .\nIf I was struggling in my 4WD truck , I could n't imagine a large ambulance being able to navigate the barely cleared roads we still needed to travel .\n\u201c Okay ... Angel of God , my Guardian Dear\u2026 \u201d my prayers continued both audibly and in my head .\nThe amount of snow that fell on our untreated roads would be something I 'll never forget .\nFinally making our way out of our hilly , dark , terrifying streets , I crept toward the main roads .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was happy that we had a full tank of gas and that some lanes were a bit more cleared .\nOn a normal day , I \u2019 d reach speeds up to 50 mph on the route I was taking .\nThat day , I never went faster than 25mph .\nIt would \u2019 ve been too dangerous .\nIt made our trip take longer but overall safer .\nI felt a sense of relief when a truck pulled out about 100 yards in front of us - it was sanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !\nWe followed the truck the last few miles to the hospital , dodging cars that had been abandoned and also trees that had not been cleared off the roadways .\nI \u2019 ve driven around obstacles before , but never so many in such a short stretch .\nFinally in the parking lot of the ER , Izzy gently maneuvered Ronan out of the backseat .\nWeakened , he took her hand and let her lead him .\nI told her , \u201c Straight to the wheelchairs , remember he loves wheelchairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed his backpack .\nI \u2019 d had Izzy also pack a backpack for herself .\nAt the time we made the ER plan , there was no telling what the conditions would be outside nor what condition Ronan would be medically .\nIf our local hospital couldn \u2019 t manage Ronan \u2019 s symptoms , which has happened before , we \u2019 d need supplies to get us through at least one night at the children \u2019 s hospital 2 hours away .\nWe hoped things wouldn \u2019 t get that bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway .\nI will never hope for a seizure , but it took having a seizure in the ER to get Ronan to move to the top of the patient list .\n\u201c He needs to go back next\u2026now , \u201d the doctor barked .\n\u201c Mrs .\nJameson , you can bring him back .\nWe \u2019 ll get his test results soon , but let \u2019 s get a chest x-ray ordered and some other labs , \u201d the ER nurse said as we wheeled Ronan through the hallway .\nLooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many patients I saw .\nEvery ER exam room was full .\nTwo of the ER hallways were also - people sitting in waiting room chairs , in wheelchairs and on gurneys .\nSome wrapped in blankets , some hunched over in discomfort , some looking far worse than Ronan .\nThe nurse apologized .\nThe weather had impacted the staff , and some were out because they couldn \u2019 t drive in through the snow .\nOthers were out because they had covid .\nIn fact , the patients in the hallways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of nurses .\nThe ones who worked upstairs where these patients needed to go were sick .\nHow tragic !\nI thought .\nPraying Ronan wouldn \u2019 t need to be admitted , another ER staff got the seizure padding attached to Ronan \u2019 s gurney .\nRonan had barely gotten a chance to transfer to the bed when his nasal swab results came back .\n\u201c Positive , \u201d the doctor who \u2019 d called him back said , \u201c Let \u2019 s plan on getting you discharged.\n\u201d She started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dropped to 92 while we were in the waiting room but now crept up to 96 .\nHis temperature , which was as high as 103.8 , had fallen to 100 .\nHis heart rate , which had jumped to 158 , was back in the 90s .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll have the nurse get you the forms .\nYou \u2019 ll want to continue to rotate fever reducers , keep him drinking liquids , and bring him back if he gets worse\u2026 \u201d But that cough , which was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted like an out-of-control yoyo .\nBut that risk for pneumonia , which is compounded due to the dysphagia , we \u2019 d been told .\nBut that seizure\u2026where there \u2019 s one , there \u2019 s always more !\nI asked for clarification when the very rushed doctor left .\nSpeaking candidly to the nurse , I asked , \u201c She thinks he \u2019 s okay to take home ?\nI was so scared\u2026just getting here was risky .\nNow she \u2019 s says it \u2019 s okay to travel back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at home ?\nWhat if he tanks again ?\n\u201d \u201c Bring him back , \u201d the young nurse offered .\n\u201c You can always bring him back.\n\u201d I should \u2019 ve fought to keep him monitored there longer , but like a friend shared with me the next day , \u201c Cathy , you do not want to have him admitted if you can avoid it .\nYou \u2019 d have no say in what they did to him .\nThey \u2019 re understaffed and don \u2019 t follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better .\nThink of it as a blessing in disguise , even with how bad things are now .\nTrust me.\n\u201d Like I \u2019 d had to trust Izzy , I trusted my friend .\nA front-line worker who \u2019 s seen the worst the medical system has to offer , she knows firsthand the horrors happening in some hospitals .\nEven so , I was very angry that we got the bare minimum from the local doctor while Ronan dealt with the worst symptoms .\nHad I had a fight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would \u2019 ve balked at the care we did receive .\nOnce we were home , and when my symptoms went into full swing , I put that anger aside .\nAnger wouldn \u2019 t get Ronan better .\nI wouldn \u2019 t get me better either .\nI won \u2019 t go into the interventions I was able to use , but with my friend \u2019 s advice to stay away from the medical center , Ronan did recover .\nI , and my other children who later tested positive , recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy road , I \u2019 ll readily admit that , but we recovered .\nThe struggle of getting better post-snowstorm , with still no power at the house , with a medically-fragile adult child who was very sick , and with me now sick , was great .\nWhat got us through was the power of prayer , small medical miracles we encountered along the way , and getting 2 hotel rooms several towns over .\nWhen Ronan \u2019 s fever spiked again after we \u2019 d come home from the ER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to help look for rooms for us .\nNeighbors were saying it would be at least another day , and up to 3-5 days later , for power to be restored .\nI \u2019 d stayed so strong for so long , but hearing that had me crying in a heap .\nSeeing me cry made Fiona cry .\nI \u2019 d relied so heavily on her .\nWithout one complaint , she \u2019 d step in before I needed to ask for her help .\nAs much as I loved being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first snow day , we both knew that home was not safe for us anymore .\nIn less than an hour , we packed up for a projected 3-5 days and got the heck out of town .\nTaking two cars - in case I needed to bring Ronan to the larger hospital we \u2019 d be near , I held back tears while driving .\nFollowing my oldest , who mapped the way for us , I gripped the steering wheel .\nAre we really doing this ?\nIs this really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that we \u2019 d had just handled .\nI was in awe at how strong my children had to be and continued to be .\n\u201c Dear Lord , \u201d I prayed .\n\u201c Please help us !\nI am not strong enough to do this anymore.\n\u201d Once checked in to the hotel rooms , more blessings poured in .\nFriends who \u2019 d also left town for a warmer place to stay happened to text me .\nWe rarely text , but she reached out , \u201c Hey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there anything you need ?\n\u201d Never one to accept help quickly , I prefer to be the helper , never the helpee .\nAbout to say No , we \u2019 re good , but thank you\u2026 I let the Holy Spirit smack me upside the head .\nYes , I replied .\nYes , please .\nDelivering food , water , soup , Gatorade , OTC meds and more , she and her husband , who were unbeknownst to me just in the next town over , dropped off groceries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near and far reached out on Thursday offering various gifts and services to us - advice , encouragement , dinners , keeping watch over our house , and even offering to clean it up , while we were out of town .\nRonan was still not out of the woods , and I had yet to go through the worst of things myself , but each call and each message I would receive made me happily overwhelmed .\nI graciously accepted everything , thanking everyone for their kindness .\nRelieved of the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for all the people when we did get to return home , I fell asleep .\nThat night , I slept the soundest I \u2019 d been able to sleep all week .\nA stranger turned friendly helper offered me the greatest advice when we were in the hotel .\nHearing the same message twice in the previous 24 hours , I took her words to heart : \u201c To grow and mature the way God wants you to , you need to accept people \u2019 s help .\nWe never give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much if we can help it .\nSo let people help you now .\nIt \u2019 s their turn to show you God \u2019 s love.\n\u201d And God \u2019 s love surely did pour in !\nTo those who helped us , thank you .\nTo those who prayed for us , who showered us with love , with groceries , with meals , with financial support , with medicine and with hope , thank you .\nTo those who are waiting so patiently to help us next , thank you also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To those who didn \u2019 t know we were in a tough situation but who now know , we \u2019 ll happily take your prayers of thanksgiving that the kids and I survived one of the most harrowing weeks ever .\nI won \u2019 t hope for another snowstorm for a long time , but I will be better prepared for the next one ( including the one forecasted for today !

a big part of special education in Kent .\nAutistic Spectrum Disorder remains the most common primary need type with 41.2 % of children and young people with an Education and Health Care Plan having ASD identified as their primary need .\nSeriously , no one anywhere is talking about these issues .\nThere is absolutely no alarm over what \u2019 s happening .\nHopes to expand ?\nI \u2019 m sure these smiling adults are very well-intentioned , but these stories about autism numbers are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention .\nQuestions should be asked .\nWhy are there always more affected children ?\nWhen is it going to stop ?\nWhy are they \u2019 re never any answers ?\nA recent story from Kent in southeast England is but one example .\nThe title reads , Life Skills Manor School , for children with autism , has opened in Sandwich , and it \u2019 s about a school for 22 students that \u201c hopes to expand to 46 Adults are often seen in photos with the stories .\nThey \u2019 re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yet another autism school , built so students won \u2019 t have to be sent to costly out-of-county schools .\nWhat is a continual mystery to me is why no one questions why this is happening .\nThey just keep calling for more funding , more services in mainstream schools and more exclusive special schools , specifically ones for children with autism .\nI added a number of stories to Loss of Brain Trust this past week which testify to the impact disabled children are having on schools , especially in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected kids are coming .\nAccording to the Kent Commissioning Plan 2021-2025 , the need for specialist placements in Kent is increasing each year by 14.8 % .\nClearly this is a new phenomenon or there would already be accommodations \u201c to meet the needs of children that are not coping in mainstream education.\n\u201d There is something about the word AUTISM that silences everyone .\nImagine the response if we were talking about children who are blind .\nIf we were building schools for the blind and talking about a 15 % @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know why so many kids can \u2019 t see .\nPeople would want it stopped .\nAutism is permanently the mysterious illness that we \u2019 ve convinced ourselves has always been around\u2014we just called it something else .\nOf course the obvious question is : Where were they back in the 1980s and 1990s and early 2000s like we see today ?\nBritain , like the U.S. , has had laws requiring local schools to educate disabled children for the last 50 years .\nSo where were the large numbers of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?\nSometimes I feel as though readers of Loss of Brain Trust and Age of Autism are the only people in the world who realize this is happening .\nThe event in Kent is typical of places across England .\nThe stories from the Isle of Wight and Bedfordshire below both talk about it being a \u201c national problem.\n\u201d \u2026there could still be a gap of \u00a31.33 million [ $ 1.8M ] funding gap

infectious disease mortalities not to doctors and health officials , but to improved nutrition and sanitation\u2014the latter credited to strict regulation of food preparation , electric refrigerators , sewage treatment , and chlorinated water .\nThe McKinlays joined Harvard \u2019 s iconic infectious disease pioneer , Edward Kass , in warning that a self-serving medical cartel would one day try to claim credit for these public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical interventions ( e.g.\n, vaccines ) on the American public.\n\u201d ( That prediction was totally accurate .\nMost of the public now believes that the vaccines were the saviors because that lie has been repeated ad nauseum . )\n\u201c As the McKinlays and Kass had predicted , vaccinologists successfully hijacked the astonishing success story \u2013 the dramatic 74 percent decline in infectious disease mortalities of the first half of the twentieth century \u2013 and deployed it to claim for themselves and particularly for vaccines , a revered and sanctified \u2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , questioning , or debate.\n\u201d ( The winners were better nutrition \u2013 fresh fruits and vegetables available year-round \u2013 and substantial improvements in sanitation .\nThese factors were responsible for reducing infectious disease mortality to near zero .\nThe claim that vaccines caused this decrease is false but is widely promoted by Big Pharma . )\nThe answer is no .\nOn page 129 , Kennedy provides the evidence : An exhaustive 2000 study by CDC and Johns Hopkins scientists published in Pediatrics , the official journal of the American Academy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not account for the impressive declines in infectious disease mortality seen in the first half of the [ 20 th ] century \u2026 nearly 90 percent of the decline in infectious disease mortality among U.S. children occurred before 1940 , when few antibiotics or vaccines were available.\n\u201d Kennedy describes Dr. Fauci \u2019 s main focus on page 122 : \u201c Over the last fifty years at NIH , Dr. Fauci has played a leading role in Big Pharma \u2019 s engineered demolition of American health and democracy , working hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory obstacles and transform the NIH and NIAID into a single-minded vehicle for development , promotion , and marketing of patented pharmaceutical products , including vaccines and vaccine-like products.\n\u201d On page 122 , Kennedy describes what has happened : \u201c Dr .\nFauci has done almost nothing to advance NIAID \u2019 s core obligation of researching the causes of the devastating explosions in epidemics of chronic allergic and autoimmune diseases that , under his tenure , have mushroomed to affect 54 percent of children , up from 12.8 percent when he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring the explosion of allergic conditions , Dr. Fauci has instead reshaped NIAID into the leading incubator for new pharmaceutical products , many of which , ironically , profit from the cascading

quotes to put things in context and to track down the references if more information is desired .\nMy comments will appear in parentheses .\nOn pages 130 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concocted a fake swine flu epidemic that temporarily raised hopes around CDC for the resurrection of its reputation as a life-saving superhero \u2026 But the swine flu pandemic was a dud , and HHS \u2019 s response was a global embarrassment .\nOnly one casualty \u2013 a soldier at Fort Dix \u2013 succumbed to the \u201c pandemic , \u201d and Merck \u2019 s experimental vaccine triggered a national epidemic of Guillain-Barre

cover-ups at HHS that led to the phony swine flu pandemic and the wave of casualties from NIH \u2019 s experimental vaccine .\nThe scandal forced the resignation of CDC Director David Sencer for his role in concocting the phony pandemic and pushing the dangerous vaccine.\n\u201d Azidothymidine , known as AZT , was originally developed as a chemotherapy drug to treat leukemia .\nThe story of AZT and how it came to be an AIDS drug is told on pages 148-150 : \u201c FDA abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against cancer and breathtakingly lethal in mice .\nGovernment researchers deemed it too toxic even for short-term regimen cancer chemotherapy.\n\u201d After HIV was identified as the probable cause of AIDS , Dr. Fauci began to promote AZT as a possible AIDS drug .\n\u201c But it did not go smoothly \u2026 AZT \u2019 s horrendous toxicity hobbled researchers struggling to design study protocols that would make it appear either safe or effective.\n\u201d Meanwhile , \u201c Community doctors were achieving promising results with off-label therapeutic drugs that seemed effective against the constellation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with AIDS \u2026 Despite years of pleading by the HIV community , Dr.

therapeutic drugs .\nBut there \u2019 s no profit in it .\nIt \u2019 s all got to be about newly patented antivirals and their mischievous vaccines.\n\u201d The movie \u201c Dallas Buyers Club \u201d

community doctors and their patients considered effective against AIDS , but that FDA refused to approve .\n\u201c Dr .\nFauci was a liar.\n\u201d Recalls Wallack , who researched Dr. Fauci intensively for her film .\n\u201c He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hostile to any product that would compete with AZT .\nHe was the real villain of this era .\nHe cost a lot of people their lives.\n\u201d One of the most promising AIDS drugs was AL 721 .\nHere is the story on page 160 : \u201c AIDS activists afterward learned that at the same time Dr. Fauci was telling them and Senator Kennedy \u2019 s office that he was finally testing AL 721 , Teflon Tony was confiding to his Pharma Pls [ Principal Investigators ] that he had rigged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c I wanted to debunk it , \u201d he assured them .\nJust as he would do with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID crisis thirty years later , he designed his AL 721 clinical trials in a way that would ensure their failure and thus discredit the unpatentable medicine.\n\u201d ( It is difficult not to feel a sense of deja-vu when we see that the same actions and tactics used during the early AIDS crisis are eerily repeated during the ongoing COVID crisis . )\nTemplate for Getting Dangerous and Ineffective Drugs Approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at using the AIDS crisis to bring a deadly , toxic , and ineffective AIDS drug to market taught Dr. Fauci some key career lessons that he would faithfully repeat again and again throughout his long regime .\nDuring his battle to win FDA approval for AZT , Dr. Fauci pioneered the strategy upon which he would build his career and then showcase for the world during the COVID epidemic.\n\u201d Kennedy then lists 30 bullet points detailing how this strategy was carried out .\nIn Chapter 5 beginning on

From the moment of my reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate in 2005 , I was astonished to realize that the pervasive web of deep financial entanglements between Pharma and the government health agencies had put regulatory capture on steroids.\n\u201d ( The CDC , FDA , and other regulators no longer protect the people from rapacious pharma corporations .\nThey now protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On page 8 , Dr Peter McCullough , MD observes that \u201c We could have dramatically reduced COVID fatalities and hospitalizations using early treatment protocols and repurposed drugs including ivermectin ( IVM ) and hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) and many , many others\u2026Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies now show that early treatment could have averted some 80 percent of deaths attributed to COVID\u2026but for Dr. Fauci \u2019 s hard-headed tunnel vision on new vaccines and Remdesivir .\n( We will see that the use of cheap and highly effective drugs was not only ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 19 , Kennedy explains that \u201c Dr .\nFauci led an effort to deliberately derail America \u2019 s access to lifesaving drugs and medicines that might have saved hundreds of thousands of lives and dramatically shortened the pandemic\u2026From the outset , HCQ and other therapeutics posed an existential threat to Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates \u2019 $ 48 billion COVID vaccine project , and particularly to their vanity drug Remdesivir , in which Gates has a large stake .\nOn page 21 there is more information on HCQ : \u201c Some 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent researchers deem HCQ safe and effective against Coronavirus , especially when taken prophylactically or when in the initial stages of illness along with zinc and Zithromax.\n\u201d ( HCQ and other effective and cheap drugs had to be suppressed in order to sell more vaccines and Remdesivir . )\nMore on page 26 : \u201c Dr .\nFauci , Bill Gates , and WHO financed a cadre of research mercenaries to concoct a series of nearly 20 studies all employing fraudulent protocols deliberately designed to discredit HCQ as unsafe .\nInstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 mg/day , the 17 WHO studies administered a borderline lethal daily dose starting with 2,400 mg on Day 1 and using 800 mg/day thereafter.\n\u201d Dr. Meryl Nass had this to say about these studies , \u201c The purpose seemed , very clearly , to poison the patients and blame the deaths on HCQ.\n\u201d ( The correct protocol is to give HCQ , zinc , and Zithromax at a dosage that is safe and effective early in the disease before the patients are critically ill .\nThese studies used borderline lethal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not use zinc and Zithromax .\nThe intent of these studies was to deliberately make HCQ appear ineffective and dangerous . )\nFraudulent studies published by The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine On page 29 , Kennedy describes these studies : \u201c Both studies in these respected publications relied on data from the Surgisphere Corporation , an obscure Illinois based medical education company that claimed to somehow control an extraordinary global database boasting access to medical information from 96,000 patients in more than 600 hospitals \u2026 The Lancet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2026 Three European nations immediately banned use of HCQ , and others followed within weeks.\n\u201d ( The Surgisphere data was fraudulently conjured up from thin air . )\nMore on page 30 : \u201c Both The Lancet and NEJM finally withdrew their studies in shame \u2026 To date neither the authors nor the journals have explained who induced them to coauthor and publish the most momentous fraud in the history of scientific publishing \u2026The capacity of their Pharma overlords to strong-arm the world \u2019 s top two medical journals into condoning deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles in the middle of a pandemic , attests to the cartel \u2019 s breathtaking power and ruthlessness \u2026 The headline of a comprehensive expose \u2019 in the British newspaper \u201c The Guardian \u201d expressed the global shock among the scientific community of the rank corruption by scientific publishing \u2019 s most formidable pillars : \u201c The Lancet has made one of the biggest retractions in modern history .\nHow could this happen ?\n\u201d The Guardian writers openly accused The Lancet of promoting fraud .\n\u201c The sheer number and magnitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too enormous to attribute to mere incompetence \u2026 What \u2019 s incredible is that the editors of these esteemed journals still have a job.\n\u201d Meanwhile in Other Countries On page 32 and 33 , Kennedy describes what was happening in other countries regarding HCQ : \u201c In compliance with the WHO recommendation , Switzerland banned the use of HCQ ; however , about two weeks into the ban , Switzerland \u2019 s death rates tripled , for about 15 days , until Switzerland reintroduced HCQ .\nCOVID deaths then fell back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c natural experiment \u201d had provided yet another potent argument for HCQ \u2026 A meta-review of 58 observational studies by physician researchers in Spain , Italy , France , and Saudi Arabia found that HCQ dramatically reduced mortality from COVID , while additional articles by doctors in Turkey , Canada , and the US found that HCQ \u2019 s cardiac toxicity is negligible .\nAndrew Schlafly ( engineer and lawyer ) observed that , \u201c The mortality rate from COVID-19 in countries that allow access to HCQ is only one-tenth the mortality rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this medication , such as the United States \u2026 In some areas of Central America , officials are even going door to door to distribute HCQ \u2026 these countries have been successful in limiting the mortality from COVID-19 to only a fraction of what it is in wealthier countries.\n\u201d On page 37 , Kennedy covers the remarkable success of IVM : \u201c By the summer of 2020 , front-line physicians had discovered another COVID remedy that equaled HCQ in its staggering , life-saving efficacy .\nFive years earlier , two Merck scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a drug with unprecedented firepower against a wide range of human parasites , including roundworm , hookworm , river blindness , and lymphatic filariasis .\nThat salute was the Nobel Committee \u2019 s only award to an infectious disease medication in 60 years .\nFDA approved IVM as safe and effective for human use in 1996. WHO includes IVM ( along with HCQ ) on its inventory of \u201c essential medicines \u201d \u2026 Millions of people have consumed billions of IVM doses as an anti-parasitic , with minimal side effects \u201d On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preventing COVID-19 is covered : \u201c In Argentina , for example , in the summer of 2020 , Dr. Hector Carvallo conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial of IVM as a preventive , finding 100 percent efficacy against COVID-19 .\nCarvallo \u2019 s team found no infections in 788 workers who took weekly IVM prophylaxis , whereas 58 percent of the 407 controls had become ill with COVID-19.\n\u201d As the U.S. Restricts IVM , Other Countries Are Increasing Its Use On pages 42 and 43 , the contrast in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. is presented : \u201c Today , as Dr. Fauci moves the U.S. to eliminate all use of IVM , other countries are using more of it .\nIn February 2021 , the head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association held a press conference to call for adding IVM to its outpatient treatment protocol .\nSeveral Indian states had added IVM to their list of essential medications to treat COVID-19 .\nIndonesia \u2019 s government not only authorized the use of the drug but also created a website showing real-time availability \u2026 El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its citizens .\nNations where residents have easy access to IVM invariably see immediate and dramatic declines in COVID deaths .\nHospitals in Indonesia started using IVM on July 22 , 2021 .\nBy the first week of August , cases and deaths were plummeting \u2026 New Delhi , India was experiencing a COVID epidemic crisis .\nThe state government obliterated 97 percent of Delhi cases by distributing IVM .\nOn pages 52 and 53 , Dr. Lawrie began by endorsing the miraculous efficacy of IVM : \u201c Had IVM been employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world first alerted the authorities to its efficacy , millions of lives could have been saved , and the pandemic with all its associated suffering and loss brought to a rapid and timely end \u2026 The story of IVM has highlighted that we are at a remarkable juncture in medical history .\nThe tools that we use to heal our patients are being systematically undermined by relentless disinformation stemming from corporate greed .\nThe story of IVM shows that we as a public have misplaced our trust in the authorities and have underestimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupts \u2026 Dr. Lawrie called out the corruption of modern medicine by Big Pharma and other interests and attributed the barbaric suppression of IVM to the single-minded obsession with more profitable vaccines.\n\u201d IVM Works Great/Can \u2019 t Have That/Got to Do Something Dr. Pierre Kory is the former Chief of the Critical Care Service and Medical Director of the Trauma and Life Support Center at the University of Wisconsin .\nOn page 54 , his testimony before the Senate and what happened next will shock you .\n\u201c When Dr. Kory \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony describing the peer-reviewed science supporting IVM went viral , prescriptions for IVM from U.S. doctors exploded .\nAmericans were getting legitimate prescriptions filled at pharmacies , up to 88,000 scripts in a single week .\nThe truth of the drug \u2019 s benefits was going viral , and the last thing Dr. Fauci et al could tolerate was an effective treatment for COVID .\nSomething needed to be done .\nThe government moved aggressively to block its use \u2026 You Tube soon scrubbed Kory \u2019 s video and Facebook blocked him .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the European Medical Association ( EMA ) , and the WHO issued statements advising against the use of IVM for COVID-19 \u2026 On July 18 , 2021 a front-page Wall Street Journal headline asked , \u201c Why is the FDA Attacking a Safe , Effective Drug ?\n\u201d On August 16 , 2021 , two weeks after the Wall Street Journal article , CDC ordered doctors to stop prescribing IVM .\n( Is it clear yet ? )\nOn pages 63-70 : \u201c Anthony Fauci needed to use all his moxie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-century at NIH , to win FDA \u2019 s approval for his vanity drug , Remdesivir .\nRemdesivir has no clinical efficacy against COVID-19 according to every legitimate study .\nWorse , it is deadly poisonous and expensive , an expensive poison at $ 3,000 per treatment \u2026 Many doctors believe our country \u2019 s record COVID-19 fatalities are at least in part due to widespread use of remdesivir in 2020 .\nWe had the most deaths worldwide says Dr. Ryan Cole .\nIt is a haunting question : How many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCullough gives us a stark and clear summary : Remdesivir has two problems .\nFirst , it doesn \u2019 t work .\nSecond , it is toxic and its kills people.\n\u201d VAERS stands for Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System .\nOn page 72 and 73 : \u201c Dr .\nFauci stubbornly refused to fix VAERS which systematically suppresses reporting of most vaccine injuries \u2026 A 2010 HHS study concluded that VAERS detects fewer that 1 percent of vaccine injuries .\nPut another way , VAERS misses OVER 99 percent of vaccine injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even the deadliest inoculations .\nIn 2010 , the federal Agency for Health Care Research Quality ( AHRQ ) designed and field-tested a state-of-the-art machine-counting system as an efficient alternative to VAERS .\nBy testing the system for several years on the Harvard Pilgrim HMO , AHRQ proved that it could capture most vaccine injuries .\nAHRQ initially planned to roll out the system to all remaining HMOs , but after seeing the AHRQ \u2019 s frightening results- vaccines were causing serious injuries in 1 of every 40 recipients- CDC killed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dusty shelf.\n\u201d ( Which entities benefit from drastic undercounting of vaccine injuries and deaths ? )\nOn page 87 and 88 : \u201c Despite CDC \u2019 s efforts to hide the carnage in the U.S. , even the dysfunctional VAERS system has recorded unprecedented waves of documented deaths following COVID vaccines \u2026 Health workers have administered many billions of vaccines during the past thirty-two years , yet in just eight months , the COVID vaccines have injured and killed far more Americans than all other vaccines combined over three decades.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take in this shocking truth . )\nThis article presents only a tiny fraction of the enormously important information in the first 100 pages of Kennedy \u2019 s book .\nStay tuned for the nuggets in the next 100 pages soon .\nAbout the author : Dr. William H.

's easier to 'exit stage left ' in clothes that are comfortable .\nOne by one , the kids pig piled into the car .\nDressed up that late afternoon because after a haircut for Ronan 's little brother , we 'd be heading to Mass .\nThe girls were in dresses and wore nice necklaces .\nTheir purses \u201c completed \u201d the outfit .\nTheir brothers were in their khaki pants and had nice shirts on .\nI was wearing one of my `` mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd love to dress up for church , if Ronan is coming with us , I need to wear pants and flats .\nToo many times , when he was much younger , I learned that I needed to wear sensible clothing to places he may not want to stay .\nCarrying him , sometimes by piggyback , while wearing a dress can be difficult .\nIt can also be embarrassing .\nI 'm not into fashion at all these days .\nActually , I never really have been .\nWhile shopping before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , shirt or pair of pants fit me , and if the price was right , I 'd get it .\nI still buy clothes that way now , including when I 'm at thrift stores ( which is my favorite place to shop ) .\nI was looking at an online retail site for a few things when I saw a section that had that The Going Out Edit title .\nBefore I saw the photo under it , I immediately thought of Ronan .\nCould edit mean what we bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ?\nI wondered .\nWe just call that stuff .\n`` Get your stuff , kids .\nBring Ronan 's , too , '' is what I yell as we 're trying to get out the door on our way out .\nA calendar full of social plans , parties and reasons to dress up again .\nThink little black dresses , tops , cute crops and pants that pair perfectly with your heels .\nJeans ?\nAbsolutely .\nWhether you \u2019 re going out with the girls , hitting the dancefloor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made to be seen in .\nBodycon dress ?\nA statement co-ord set ?\nA halter top and jeans for that classic \u2018 jeans and a nice top \u2019 look ?\nReal big vibes .\nRefresh your wardrobe , grab your clutch\u2014we \u2019 re going out .\nSometimes the new teen/young adult lingo goes right over my head .\nIn case one of my kids began to use the phrase , I wanted to check it out and see what it meant .\nSure enough , it 's the things you wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff you add on to your outfit .\nFrom Cotton : On I don \u2019 t know much about marketing , but I do know that fancy words in ads can help make a bigger sale .\nI thought about that when I saw a phrase I didn \u2019 t recognize : The Going Out Edit .\nI knew it had something to do with fashion , maybe even high fashion .\nBut that was it .\nWhatever it was included a dollar sign .\nSomething else that makes things easier for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to bring Ronan 's stuff , which I guess is what his Going Out Edit would be .\nHe must be ahead of the trend because we 've always carried a bag with us whenever he goes out .\nIt does n't matter if it 's to the store , a doctor 's appointment , or when he joins me to pick up siblings from school .\nA bag , or his Going Out Edit if we want to make it sound a bit upscale , must come with us .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , but now it must have : his Guardianship documents , papers I never thought I 'd have to bring but go with me everywhere he goes when he 's with me There 's nothing fashionable about any of that stuff , but every single thing in his bag is important .\nWhen we have them , life is easier\u2026or at least more manageable .\nIf I leave one thing behind , I worry that I 'm going to need it .\nThat happened years ago when Ronan had grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed it , but I \u2019 d forgotten to bring his emergency medication with me .\nSince then , every time we head out now , the bag goes with us .\nHanging on a hook in the front closet , it 's become second nature to grab it .\nIt came with us on our outing last weekend and , as usual , served a great purpose .\nRonan needed that favorite book and his favorite picture 25 minutes into Mass last Saturday night .\nHe 'd already done a really great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't his turn for a trim , he followed the well-established routine his brother and my husband have taught him when they go to the barber .\nThe barber is always welcoming and is more than accommodating to my son .\nRonan knows she keeps a secret stash of candy , which he never gets anywhere else , also helps .\nI know that candy may not be the most nutritious reinforcement .\nBut in those moments when nothing else worked to get him in the door , in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the buzzing and the extra noise in her barbershop , it helps .\nRonan can now sit through a professional haircut every other month like a champ .\nLike last time he was there , we also headed to church immediately after the appointment .\nI \u2019 m glad we did because , like last time , Ronan stayed for the entire Mass !\nIt isn \u2019 t our home parish that we go to on those days , but we \u2019 ve been going there often enough over the last 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church and the expectations of being there is great .\nWhat \u2019 s even better is when the routine we ask him to follow goes smoothly .\nLike the last time we all went , staying for the entire Mass wasn \u2019 t easy , though .\nThat \u2019 s when the strategies , and Ronan \u2019 s stuff , comes into play .\nIt \u2019 s always around the Gospel that Ronan wants to leave .\nWith his black fish , the page of the cat image opened , awkward hugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother \u2019 s gentle directions , I \u2019 m happy to share that Ronan made it through !\nYou know that means we all made it through Mass , too .\nRonan got a little antsy after I received communion , so I quickly set a timer on my phone .\nWe had less then 10 minutes left at that point .\nSomething I prayed he \u2019 d be able to tolerate .\nAgain , with one more awkward hug , we walked out after the recessional hymn was sung .\nSuccess !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they continue to give no matter the situation .\nRonan is very much a part of their every-day life now .\nThat means the siblings can still help him , not just because they \u2019 re capable but because they want to .\nLike me , they celebrate the little things with him because they bring huge victories for all of us .\nJust walking out the door can be a showstopper .\nHaving all of the items we need in that bag of Ronan \u2019 s , plus some positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all allows him to continue to try , try again .\nI know that my kids \u2019 paths are not always going to include living with us or caring for Ronan on a daily basis , so I \u2019 ll cherish these little moments now .\nThose moments , along with all the knowledge we \u2019 ve gained along the way , can bring us such joy .\nThey can provide a

Kennedy Jr .\nIf HIV Doesn \u2019 t Cause AIDS , What Does ?\nIt turns out that multiple things may cause AIDS individually or in combination : ( 1 ) Heavy recreational drug use is strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in AIDS .\nThis is discussed on page 221 .\n( 2 ) On page 225 another possible culprit is discussed : \u201c After 1987 , Dr. Duesberg and his followers argue , the vast majority of \u201c AIDS deaths \u201d were actually caused by AZT\u2014Dr .\nFauci \u2019 s radical \u201c antiretroviral \u201d chemotherapy purposely concocted to kill human cells .\nDuesberg describes the syndrome as \u201c AIDS by AZT.\n\u201d Ironically , he argued AZT , the highly toxic medication that Dr. Fauci was prescribing to treat AIDS patients , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , it causes AIDS itself.\n\u201d The cases of ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev and Tennis star Authur Ashe are discussed on page 227 .\nBoth died of AIDS after taking AZT .\nAshe followed his doctor \u2019 s advice in taking a very high dose of AZT even though he had misgivings .\nNureyev ignored his doctor \u2019 s warnings about the deadly effects of AZT and insisted on taking it .\n( 3 ) On page 235 , a bacterium-like organism called mycoplasma is discussed as another possible cause of AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS may be discovered in the future .\nWhat Will Happen When the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis is Finally Proven Wrong ?\nOn page 237 , Dr. Harvey Bialy is quoted : \u201c \u2026It is not much of an exaggeration to state that when the HIV/AIDS hypothesis is finally recognized as wrong , the entire institution of science will lose the public \u2019 s trust and science itself will experience fundamental , profound , and long-lasting changes .\nThe scientific community has risked its credibility by standing by the HIV theory for so long .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now tantamount to doubting science itself , and this is why dissidents face excommunication.\n\u201d On pages 245-248 , some of the details of these unconscionable experiments are explained : \u201c In 2004 , investigative journalist Liam Scheff chronicled Dr. Fauci \u2019 s secretive experiments on hundreds of HIV-positive foster children at Incarnation Children \u2019 s Center ( ICC ) in New York City and numerous sister facilities in New York and six other states between 1988 and 2002 .\n[ It turns out that not all of these children were HIV-positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Fauci \u2019 s career-defining effort to develop a second generation of profitable AIDS drugs as an encore to AZT.\n\u201d \u201c Scheff described how Dr. Fauci \u2019 s NIAID and his Big Pharma partners turned Black and Hispanic foster kids into lab rats , subjected to torture and abuse in a grim parade of unsupervised drug and vaccine studies \u2026 Dr. Fauci had the safety oversight board rigged with his loyal PIs [ Principal Investigators ] , foremost of whom was Dr. Stephen Nicholas , a generously funded NIAID AIDS researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are toxic\u2014they \u2019 re known to cause genetic mutations , organ failure , bone marrow death , bodily deformations , brain damage , and fatal skin disorders \u2026 If the children refuse the drugs , they \u2019 re held down and force fed .\nIf the children continue to resist , they \u2019 re taken to Columbia Presbyterian hospital , where a surgeon puts a plastic tube through their abdominal wall into their stomachs .\nFrom then on the drugs are injected directly into their intestines.\n\u201d ( This is so sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil could actually have happened , but it did happen and Dr. Fauci was in charge . )\n\u201c Vera Sharav spent years investigating Dr. Fauci \u2019 s torture chambers as part of her lifelong mission to end cruel medical experimentation on children .\nSharav told me , \u201c Fauci just brushed all those dead babies under the rug.\n\u201d Sharav said that at least eighty children died in Dr. Fauci \u2019 s Manhattan concentration camp and accused NIAID and its partners of disposing of children \u2019 s remains in mass graves.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pig Kids , \u201d chronicles the savage barbarity of Dr. Fauci \u2019 s science projects from the perspective of the affected children .\nThat year , BBC hired investigative reporter Celia Farber to conduct field research for the film , which exposes the dark underside of Big Pharma \u2019 s stampede to develop lucrative new AIDS remedies .\n\u201c I found the mass grave at Gate of Heaven cemetery in Hawthorne , New York , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t believe my eyes .\nIt was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which you could actually lift up .\nUnder it one could see dozens of plain wooden coffins , haphazardly stacked .\nThere may have been 100 of them .\nI learned there were more than one child \u2019 s body in each .\nAround the pit was a semi-circle of several large tombstones on which upward of one thousand children \u2019 s names had been engraved .\nI wrote down every name.\n\u201d ( \u201c Guinea Pig Kids \u201d and related documentaries are still on YouTube , but they could be disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c must watch \u201d for those interested in this dark chapter of medical history .\nThe one titled \u201c Silent Epidemic \u201d which is 25:45 in length tells the sad story of a foster couple who took in two half-sisters .\nThe girls were experiencing neurological and emotional symptoms .\nThey stopped the medications and the girls blossomed into happy and healthy children , but the authorities took the girls back and actually convicted the foster mom of child abuse for stopping the toxic medications .\nThere was definitely child abuse involved but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster mom . )\nAt Least Fourteen Thousand Children Were Forced to Take Part in These Unethical Experiments On page 252 : \u201c During the decades since Dr. Fauci took over NIAID , he has sanctioned drug companies to experiment on at least fourteen thousand children , many of them Black and Hispanic orphans living in foster homes .\nHe permitted these companies to operate without oversight or accountability .\nUnder Dr. Fauci \u2019 s laissez faire rubric , these companies systematically abused and occasionally killed children.\n\u201d How to Cheat on Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific studies on drugs would have an experimental group or study group that got the drug and a control group that got some harmless pill called a placebo .\nIf the drug was toxic , it would show very clearly with many more injuries and deaths in the experimental group .\nDrug companies that wanted to make a toxic drug appear less toxic came up with a clever way to cheat .\nOn page 259 : \u201c When they can get away with it .\nPharma researchers commonly employ the highly unethical gimmick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to mask injuries in the study group .\nThe absence of an inert placebo comparator group allows PhD grifters to dismiss all injuries and deaths in the study group as sad coincidences not associated with the drug they are testing .\n( The researchers make sure that the \u201c control group \u201d gets something as toxic as the drug being tested instead of a harmless placebo .\nThis assures that injuries and deaths in both groups are similar and can then be disregarded .\nThis is a diabolical and fraudulent experimental method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous drugs approved . )\nExample of Blatant Cheating to Get a Highly Toxic Drug Approved A drug named Nevirapine was promoted as a way to prevent HIV-positive pregnant women from passing HIV to their babies .\nThe story of this drug is told on pages 259 -274 .\nThe original protocol for a clinical trial in Uganda called for an inert placebo control group , but the placebo group was scrapped and the \u201c control group \u201d got Dr. Fauci \u2019 s horrendously dangerous chemotherapy/AIDS concoction AZT .\nThis study was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine print showed that 16 babies died in the Nevirapine group and 22 babies died in the AZT group .\nI doubt the mothers of these dead babies would characterize this clinical trial as successful .\nIt turned out that Nevirapine went on to kill many African mothers and babies and proved ineffective at preventing the passing of HIV from pregnant women to their babies .\nOn page 274 : \u201c And the real losers in that battle , added Farber [ investigative journalist ] were the millions of African women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug that does not prevent AIDS but sickens and kills people who take it .\nIn the end , Dr. Fauci succeeded in rigging corrupt clinical trials , concealing catastrophic cheating , and deftly manipulating the politics to bring his dangerous and ineffective drug , Nevirapine , to market.\n\u201d Where Did the COVID-19 Virus Come From ?\nProminent Virologists Have Been Lavishly Rewarded for Saying It Must Have Come from Nature .\nOn page 297 : \u201c \u2026When revelations that the COVID-19 virus was likely the product of genetic engineering , threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatched the handpicked elite of virology \u2019 s officer corps to draft and sign the consequential editorials published in Nature and The Lancet in February and March of 2020 assuring the world that the lab leak hypothesis was a \u201c crackpot \u201d conspiracy.\n\u201d ( Those scientists who joined in to crush the idea of a lab leak have been rewarded with huge grants for their research .\nLoyalty to Dr. Fauci pays off .\nRecent information indicates that the lab leak theory is likely correct . )\nLeaders of Several Countries Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 308 , Kennedy writes : \u201c While unusual numbers of Black celebrities were dying postvaccination in America , an eyebrow-raising number of anti-vax political leaders were simultaneously expiring in Africa \u2026 The Internet assassination speculations reached a boil following the strange murder of President Jovenel Moise of Haiti by a team of elite , well-trained Columbian mercenaries with links to United States intelligence agencies \u2026 I do not endorse the theory that these men were murdered , nor do I dismiss such speculation out of hand .\nIt is na\u00efve to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trillion-dollar industry allied with Western military and intelligence agencies do so without risk.\n\u201d ( Is it a surprise to anyone that the new leaders of these countries were very much in favor of the COVID-19 vaccines ?\nAn old saying applies here : \u201c If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a

"Women with autism can struggle with their period .\nThink about the discomfort of cramps and the sensory issue of wearing a pad .\nMany years ago , I was explaining these challenges to a friend with a neurotypical daughter , and she asked quite innocently , `` Maybe she should use tampons ? ''\nSure , for a young lady who can manage her self care independently , tampons are an option .\nBut for a female who needs full or even hand over hand assistance , a tampon is out of the question for obvious safety reasons .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters decided that pads were no longer comfortable , after years of wearing them .\nShe took her pad off within minutes .\nThe results were a disaster .\nI was at a loss to help her through what I hoped was a stage .\nI had heard about period panties but was skeptical .\nI found a review of THINX , from a company right in New York , and ordered 3 pair .\nThey were a Godsend for us .\nAnd now , other , less expensive versions have hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Secret 's PINK brand .\nBelow is a review .\nSheThinx Brand Super HipHugger size L : $ 35.00 with specials and $ 10 referral coupons offered regularly I invested in 3 pair of SheThinx period panties in 2017 .\nThey cost $ 35 per pair and are reusable .\nThey are beautifully made , substantial without being bulky , very pretty , and soft as SILK .\nNo one would know they are n't just lovely underwear .\nThey are fully lined and they have an ORGANIC cotton line .\nThey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are tagless .\nMy daughter slipped them on without issue .\nThey weigh 73 grams .\nAND THEY WORKED !\nThey hold hours worth of the heaviest flow , without a leak .\nYou can see their line of products at www.shethinx.com .\nThe downside ?\nYou have to rinse them very well before washing .\nI put them in my laundry sink and it 's a messy process .\nThen you need to line dry them , which takes some time .\nI place them on a large fan ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ & Shop many years ago , if you remember my memoir story ) to dry .\nAlso , you have to change them , and then put them in a baggie to bring home to wash , so if you are at school , or work , or out for dinner and need a change , it can be awkward .\nOur original panties have lasted several years .\nOur newer panties are even higher quality , as THINX has continued to improve them .\nThey are worth every penny .\nWe swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brand Size Large : $ 16.50 One of my home care team staff bought a pair of the VS Pink line of new period panty for us to try .\nThey are flimsy compared to SheThinx .\nThe large foil cherries ( ahem ) decoration on the back added a sensory layer we did not need .\nAnd they have 5 , count them , 5 tags that will cause sensory issues .\nThey weigh 42 grams compared to THINX ' 73 grams .\n.\nThat said , they come in lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbency fabric covers a much smaller area than the THINX - women move , dance , jump , squat , sit , stand , play sports .\nFor us , they did not work well as SheThinx .\nI think they would be a great backup panty for a young woman who is wearing a tampon and wants to prevent leak stains .\nWashing was similar , rinse and line dry .\nThey work , though not as well as the THINX in my opinion , because they have a smaller absorbent material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the PINK designs are cuter and more fun , which would matter to most girls , just not mine !\nVerdict : An investment in SheThinx is worth every penny .\nThe beat PINK 's version in that they are leak free , almost 40 % heavier and lined fabric , beautiful quality , with several colors , an organic cotton line and athletic pants and more .\nBuying the PINK version is also an option , as you can buy 2 for 1 , but then you will have more pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to store in a bag at your desk , or locker or elsewhere , when you change .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

environment they normally rely on , they had to rely on instinct and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t think they were helpless at all .\nRather , for that night \u2019 s seeker , it was the opposite !\nIt was thrilling , exhilarating , and exciting .\nWith no light , with no sense of direction , and with nothing but her instincts as her guide , she confidently prepared to search for the others .\nI \u2019 m not sure what inspired them to play a game they call Bind and Go Seek , but it is absolutely one of the best games my children love to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could fill a whole morning or afternoon .\nWhat are the rules ?\nHave fun , and be careful .\nHow do you play ?\nImagine 3 of Ronan \u2019 s siblings giggling with glee as they tiptoe , scamper , and chase each other through the house .\nThen , imagine the other sibling trying to keep up with the others while blindfolded .\nSo far , knock on wood , no one has been injured during a game .\nThey \u2019 ve grown closer to each other , albeit not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibling ties as well as hours \u2019 worth of laughter .\nI know I \u2019 ve mentioned it here before , but I am really proud of my kids .\nThey are not perfect .\nHardly .\nBut they are a lot of fun and pretty creative , too .\nI love to see their creations and am in awe of how quickly and easily it is for them to think-outside-the-box when they play .\nI encourage them always to think outside the box , not just when they play or when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , but for life in general .\nI wanted to blurt out a litany of warnings \u2013 Be careful !\nGo left !\nWatch out for the chair !\nThe wall !\nThe wall !\nWatch out for the wall !\nAs usually happens , someone giggled , and the seeker caught a break .\nSearching for the source of the giggles , she headed in that direction .\nThe giggles were stifled and silence filled the house .\nIt became increasingly harder to seek the sibling the longer the game went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up though .\nNone of them ever do .\nHow determined and willing to walk blindly around the house for as long as they have in the past while looking for the siblings , reminded me of some of the parents I \u2019 ve run into over the last dozen or so years \u2013 none of them have ended the pursuit either .\nDue to the nature of the spectrum of issues autism can bring , I \u2019 ve found that parents pursue different things .\nSome wish to find the \u201c magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine or a concoction of supplements to reduce or eliminate a negative behavior .\nOthers pursue more than just an appropriate education \u2013 they look for an enriching environment where their child is not just accepted , challenged and taught real-life skills , too .\nOthers search for answers .\nThey desire to know all there is to know about autism , to include how their child fell onto the spectrum .\nOf all the searches one can do , that search can be the most difficult .\nAt one point , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have to blindly search for answers these days .\nI have many more resources available now , literally at my fingertips , than I did when my son first got sick .\nBack then , in the early 2000s , I relied on books and other academic resources at a college library .\nToday , I can find those resources and so much more online .\nStudies on vaccines , research papers about autism , medical textbooks about neurological disorders and gastrointestinal issues , for instance\u2014those are all readily available , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wishes to take the time to educate themselves on the many topics related to autism .\nSome days I feel as if I \u2019 ve looked up all there is to know about autism .\nI know I haven \u2019 t .\nPlus , the science isn \u2019 t settled on the disorder nor on what causes it .\nIf it were settled , those treating children with autism and those who are constantly working on bettering the lives of those with autism would be out of a job .\nThose roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part , the role of caring for and managing every aspect of that child \u2019 s diagnosis falls on the shoulders of the parents .\nOf course , professionals , like teachers , therapists and medical providers , are also pitching in .\nProfessionals , particularly the ones whose passion drives their career , have a grand opportunity\u2014that is , to help parents make the difficult but necessary decisions to meet the needs of their child \u2019 s health , education , and quality of life .\nMany of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally important .\nTo make informed decisions , parents must learn how to navigate the system .\nFor some , especially for those whose child is severely affected , that turns into a full-time job .\nWith how much there is to know and with how overwhelming it might be in the beginning , parents may feel as if they are blindfolded seekers .\nThey embark into the unknown not knowing which direction to go or whom they can trust .\nBefore they gain their footing , they may feel lost , lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , and topics they never knew existed .\nWith time , though , and with assistance from parents several steps ahead of them , those parents starting out can find that , eventually , some things will get easier .\nTwo weeks ago , I needed to push the Easy Button .\nThankfully , that day came during a slow week .\nWith the kids on spring break , I , too , took a \u201c break \u201d and stopped the reading I was doing .\nI had started a new search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another search on a therapy we \u2019 ve not yet tried but were interested in .\nThe more I read , the more I needed to look up .\nNot surprisingly , even for a veteran seeker-mom like me , I began to feel overwhelmed .\nInstead of continuing and catching up on the latest autism news , I sat down on the couch in the living room and just sat .\nMy kids swarmed wanting to know what we were going to do that day .\nI told them nothing .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t have any plans .\nI needed a day to not race out the door , to put the books down , to not worry about autism and vaccines and maladaptive behaviors in public .\nI wanted to just be .\nSo I sat .\nThe kids were disappointed that I wasn \u2019 t taking them somewhere fun that day , so that \u2019 s when they started a marathon Blind and Go Seek game .\nWith just a blindfold , four excited and willing siblings darted this way and that while filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter .\nWhen I \u2019 ve been the blindfolded seeker , I was not playing a game , there was no laughter , and I rarely smiled .\nBut especially knowing that Ronan is the ultimate winner , I was very willing to continue seeking .\nAfter pushing the Easy Button those few days ago , I got back into the game .\nI found time the next day to read one article , to take a

\u00a313.2million [ $ 17.9M ] for the remainder of the framework term , until it expires in 2023 .\n\u201c The need for an increase in capacity has led to a programme for delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism

they \u2019 re alarmed at how many students are being sent away from Washington .\nThey argue it highlights a growing crisis , underscoring the lack of options for people with disabilities and the need for Washington lawmakers to invest more into special education so students can stay in school at home .\n\u2026Both attorneys are worried about the sheer number of out-of-state placements and the

Milestones on Time \u2013 It Makes a Difference", "content": "We lived in a small , rural town at the time and would see familiar faces wherever we went .\nOne evening , while waiting in line to pay for my groceries , I looked up and saw the pediatrician .\nShe had gotten in line behind us and said hello .\nNot wanting to take advantage of her personal time , I told her she was on my list of people to call that week .\nShe quizzically said , \u201c Oh ?\nIs everything okay ?\n\u201d Fully taking advantage of her piqued interest , I continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s wrong .\nRonan \u2019 s still not walking.\n\u201d Ronan had crawled on time and began to pull up on furniture on time , but he was still not able to stand completely on his own .\nI knew about late walkers , my daughter was a tad late to walk , but he was almost 16 months old .\nTo me , that was concerning .\nRonan was getting a little old for not being able to walk according to the major milestone list I \u2019 d studied years ago in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having about my own child \u2019 s growth and development proved helpful .\nOf course , the nagging part wasn \u2019 t so pleasant , but knowing that something wasn \u2019 t right gave me a reason to talk with our doctor .\nI rarely had to make an appointment for my first child , beyond the scheduled well-child visits , but I knew the option existed .\nWhen Ronan didn \u2019 t hit a major milestone , walking , I \u2019 d planned to make a call about his development by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I didn \u2019 t need to make that cold call .\nI ran into our doctor at the grocery store before my self-imposed deadline .\nMy teaching career had me engaged with children of all ages and with typical abilities .\nThe very few students I encountered with special needs in the classroom tugged at my heart .\nWhile I couldn \u2019 t compare my life with them , nor their parents , I had basic knowledge of what support they needed to be successful students .\nBoth in and out of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information I learned and for the experiences I had .\nThat helped me to know that I needed to leap to action as a young mother sooner rather than later .\nLooking at the paper now , it \u2019 s clear that Ronan was not hitting some childhood milestones .\nI knew that when I was jotting those notes down , not just because of later visits with the pediatrician , but because of my college studies .\nI majored in Human Development and Family Studies .\nMy focus was child development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nursery school .\nI used that information about milestones for research papers as I entered my 20s .\nI cited it frequently after college and later into my 30s .\nI have a handwritten note in a folder that goes with me to every doctor \u2019 s appointment I make for my son .\nThe paper isn \u2019 t that old .\nWell , in terms of today \u2019 s technological advances , it may be - it \u2019 s from a dot-matrix printer we used to own in the late 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son was making .\nThose weren \u2019 t just memories I wanted to preserve ; they were my guide to knowing that my son was , for a time , on time with his development .\nAfter a quick discussion and an unofficial exam while Ronan was sitting in the grocery cart , she said she \u2019 d have her nurse call me .\nAgreeing that something potentially wasn \u2019 t right , the doctor wasn \u2019 t sure if she could say what it was but knew that we should do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I knew what to expect and that our doctor listened to me at the neighborhood Food Lion that night .\nWithin days , we were in the pediatrician \u2019 s office and then referred to early intervention services .\nMore questions , more tests , more brainstorming , and then building the early intervention team , would take weeks to coordinate .\nThe prescribed therapies the team later determined Ronan needed didn \u2019 t start until months later .\nLike how milestones build one upon the other , so are the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that haven \u2019 t been achieved .\nIt takes determination , and sometimes demands , to get it all done as well .\nParents aren \u2019 t always listened to .\nEven when they are , they don \u2019 t always get the best replies in return .\nThe worst ones , besides a flat out no for a request a parent might make , is the \u201c Let \u2019 s wait and see \u201d reply .\nHad I been told to wait and see if Ronan would miraculously get up and start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills .\nHe did in time , thankfully , begin to walk .\nBut that did not happen until he was 2.5 years old .\nI \u2019 ll never forget that day .\nWe pulled up to our church for Sunday Mass .\nHand-in-hand with my husband on one side and I on the other , Ronan let go and walked into church as if he \u2019 d been walking for years .\nIt was breathtaking to see him finally so able and so confident on his own two feet .\nThat accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been waiting a long time to celebrate .\nIt was back to work that next day , though , with therapists , the special education team , and some caring caregivers .\nWhile working tirelessly with the physical therapist and more professionals , we \u2019 d see that other skills , reflexes , and typical developmental markers were also concerning .\nThe longer it took Ronan to accomplish what his typical peers could do , the more we depended on the team to help us .\nMost were pleasant to work with .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do at home and find ways to involve the family .\nSome were not so pleasant and made therapy or follow-up testing frustrating .\nThat \u2019 s why I \u2019 d stay current with what was happening in the child development world .\nIf I knew what to expect next , I could better advocate for my son .\nI would suggest the same for today \u2019 s parents .\nBut I wouldn \u2019 t use today \u2019 s updated milestone standards .\nNot to sound like an old fuddy duddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my day\u2026 \u201d comes to mind as I think about what parents today could do when they look at how their child is ( or isn \u2019 t ) developing .\nThe newly published data glosses over some items that were an on-going standard .\nThey extend the timeframe of when other skills should occur .\nIn the beginning , I \u2019 d always adjusted the milestone markers an extra month because Ronan was premature , but what \u2019 s expected now is well beyond some of that typical timeframe .\nThat timeframe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child \u2019 s development but for when to get the ball rolling if , and especially when , intervention is needed .\nThat then delays when a therapist or educator will be consulted .\nThat then further delays any scheduling of therapies or interventions .\nThat can compound the child \u2019 s frustration and the parents \u2019 need for their own support .\nWhat can today \u2019 s parents do ?\nLook at the milestone charts we used .\nAdjust for prematurity , if necessary , and compare what your son or daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge we \u201c old \u201d folks have been sharing so that you don \u2019 t have to live the reality we did and that some still do .\nIf your children are not meeting milestones , I \u2019 d begin the process of seeking help now .\nTime truly is of the essence .\nIf my son \u2019 s development was measured by today \u2019 s tools , I can \u2019 t imagine how long it would take to get a proper diagnosis .\nI can \u2019 t imagine the waitlists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when today \u2019 s children begin to fall off the new charts like mine did .\nI remember years ago asking , along with other parents , where \u2019 s the outrage from the well-established and retired pediatricians when the autism numbers began to rise .\nThe United States had carried the 1 in 10,000 statistic for autism for many years .\nSome doctors did address the growing concern of how many were so quickly falling onto the spectrum , but the majority , it seemed , didn \u2019 t .\nInstead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going on with this cohort of humans , the CDC calming chalked it up to \u2018 better diagnosing \u2019 .\nThat became a narrative when the rate increased and continues even now .\nI wonder if the same relaxed attitude will follow the CDC \u2019 s quietly changed milestone expectations .\nI \u2019 m quick to forget that the CDC \u2019 s full name includes prevention ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention ) .\nImagine if we could prevent some of the delays that already exist .\nIf delays could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease .\nWe \u2019 re at an all-time high for children needing something , be it a therapy , accommodation , or medical intervention , to get through childhood .\nWill the CDC and other organizations work to help prevent or reduce that need , or will they just continue to document that it \u2019 s happening ?\nToday \u2019 s children are being bombarded with much more than other children have previously .\nScreens are everywhere , the internet is accessible at all times , some schools are overcrowded , underfunded or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that life stressors have increased exponentially .\nParents are feeling bombarded also .\nWhat can a parent do to combat the constant busyness today \u2019 s world is throwing at them and at our youngest citizens ?\nIf it were up to me , I \u2019 d prescribe more playtime , more opportunities for face-to-face language development , more healthy food options and intake , more time off screens , and more time exploring the natural environment outside .\nI don \u2019 t just wonder if it some of that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would .\nAnd not just for a child \u2019 s physical growth , but for the families \u2019 emotional and mental health as well .\nMaybe if we go back to simpler times , things could improve for this and for future generations .\nI can only hope stepping away from what is potentially causing problems now can do the something positive for children \u2019 s futures .\nThat may not be the best answer or what some people want to hear , but it \u2019 s a simple start .\nJust like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step by himself on May 1st all those years ago .\nIt was a start that eventually lead to other gains .\nChildhood is about making gains , one meaningful accomplishment at a time .\nI hope and pray that kids today get the chance to experience that .\nCathy Jameson is a Contributing Editor for Age of

autism and while I know a lot about autism science in general , I would never condescend to know the needs of HFA than the HFA people themselves !\nDena Gassner identifies as a person with autism She is working on her PhD .\nMs. Gassner , routinely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee \u2019 s time .\nDeena presents herself as an expert in ALL that is autism .\nGassner , all too frequently , expounds , in minute detail on dozens of behavioral studies no one asked to discuss .\nMs. Gassner has college graduate son also on the spectrum AND claims to be able to fully represent children like mine and Alison \u2019 s !\nHowever , here on planet earth , when it comes to severe autism , I promise you she would not last an hour caring for my son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caring person , but because she has never lived this life .\nMy late Mom grew up in a big , noisy family .\nShe taught me a lot about speaking in order to be heard : \u201c be specific and get to the point !\n\u201d I would rehearse school presentations with her and she would comment , \u201c Too many ahhhs and umms , start over !\n\u201d Or \u201c you already said enough about that , cut it\u2026..people \u2019 s eyes will glaze over here , too many details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time management and being heard .\nUltimately , be mindful of others time .\nDuring public comments , long time parent advocate and president of Autism Science Foundation , Alison Singer , gave simple and straightforward speech about the lack of representation of on the committee of people like her daughter .\nMs Singer \u2019 s daughter has profound ASD and is under represented , meanwhile the HFA community is grossly over representation on IACC .\nSinger also expressed concern that the HFA community is very judgmental of parent advocates and are quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThat will soon play out !\n!\n!\nParents of severely affected kids are castigated by the HFA community for \u201c abusing their children \u201d by sending their child for ABA instruction .\nAnother frequent criticism by the HFA community is that parents are cruel and \u201c wanting perfect children , and \u201c not accepting them ( the autistic child ) for who they are.\n\u201d Severely , or profoundly affected ASD people make up 60 % of the spectrum and are virtually unrepresented at IACC and in NIH autism research .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really nice job making sure our priorities , such as GI problems , SIBs , autoimmune dysfunction are included in Strategic Plan .\nHowever , these issues , so central to profound autism , rarely discussed by committee members .\nIf such parents are on the committee , I haven \u2019 t heard a word from them .\nHence , families like mine are not represented .\nI have a severely ASD son and I rarely hear ACC members addressing issues that affect him .\nI hear all about trans & intersectional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of transparence in community engagement and ASD people with \u201c high support needs !\n\u201d That phrase is flat out absurd !\nIt sounds like an architectural term !\nA long-time criticism of IACC is the inadequate representation of people with severe autism .\nInstead of listening to these voices , Dr. Gordon has created a committee that is almost entirely composed of High Function Autistic ( HFA ) individuals .\nIronically , there is a LOT of talk at IACC about \u201c equity in representation , \u201d \u201c intersectionality \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Yet when it comes to the talking the talk and walking the walk , Dr. Gordon appoints few if any parents of severely autistic kids .\n60 % of the spectrum not represented ay IACC .\nMs. Gassner insists \u201c with the right supports and services \u201d everything will be fine for most with profound ASD .\nThat is such a false and reductive comment .\nMost of those on the severe side of ASD are afflicted with numerous complex medical issues : epilepsy , GI disease , autoimmune dysfunction , serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are not problems that can be solved with supportive aides or community housing !\nMs. Gassner , how often do u clean fecal matter off the wall ?\nA lot of mons of severely ASD kids must do this daily .\nHow many times has your son almost died of a seizure ?\nHappened twice to us .\nHow often did your son scream in pain an attempt to bang his head on the ground because of chronic constipation ?\nThis happened to the child of a friend of mine daily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in a row did u fail to get a good night \u2019 s sleep because your ASD child woke up screaming every night ?\nI have friends who have not sleep through the night for 7 years .\nHow often is your family in financial crisis because the cost of out of network but essential medical help ?\nHow many times has your son been hospitalized ?\nMy son has been hospitalized five times and that \u2019 s small time compared to my friend \u2019 s severe ASD kids .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely autistic people want seats at the table .\nAdditionally , you owe Alison Singer an apology for your rude response to her very sensible request .\nSinger made a reasonable request as a mother and as a member of this community and instead of taking in this autism mother \u2019 s point of view , you reacted with arrogance .\nDenna , cultivate some humility .\nThe committee \u2019 s crazed one sided reaction to Ms. Singer \u2019 s very reasonable request , only proved her point .\nIACC \u2019 s lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound autism is , and inexplicable rage at the mom of a severely affected child , demonstrate that no one on IACC understand Singer \u2019 s concerns.\n!\nThey do not get it .\nA half a dozen committee members instantly attacked Ms. Singer , condemning her with nonsensical arguments .\nFor example , parents of severe kids want tracking devices in case of child elopement .\nA committee member said that \u2019 s awful and tracking devices should only be allowed when the ASD person can consent and remove device themselves !\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracking device !\nI mean , where do we even go with that ?\nFor quite some time , Dr , Gordon allowed IACC members to needlessly excoriate Ms. Singer from a place of arrogance .\nTo make matters worse , Dr. Gordon , presented the issue as one of perception , not of reality .\n\u201c Alison rightly or wrongly believes profound autism not well represented here.\n\u201d Dr Gordon , she \u201c rightly perceives , \u201d this !\n!\nIt was you who choose an autism committee composed of nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son has severe and medically complex autism and he represents far more members of the ASD world than Ms. Gassner .\nDr. Gordon , you need to wake up wake up !\nDue to the make up of the committee , only one person echoed Alison \u2019 s concerns .\nDr. Matt Siegel shared important recently published research demonstrating that 2/3 of all autism treatment studies focus exclusively on those with HFA .\nPeople with moderate to severe autism represent 60 % of the spectrum yet are only the focus of 1/3 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endless talk about the need for \u201c equity \u201d among IACC committee members , but no follow through when it matters .\nDr. Jennifer Johnson is the Dept Commissioner Administration for People with Disabilities at the Dept of Health and Human Services .\nJohnson spoke for what seemed like a long time , but managed to say little .\n\u201c High needs\u2026.community support\u2026.characterization of individuals \u2026.intersectionality\u2026..community services\u2026context of available support.\n\u201d This is torture !\nPlease , I am begging you , ease up on bureaucracy talk , use specifics and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point that there is no need for living facilities for people with profound autism .\nAll this population needs to the right , \u201c community supports and services.\n\u201d It physically pains me that Ms. Johnson is so close minded .\nGuess what , Dr. Johnson , we all tried community support and services and it did not work !\n!\n!\nPeople , like my son , can not always thrive locally .\nThe noise of the city became oppressive to my him and he longed for more physical freedom ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) .\nThere are also very few appropriate learning opportunities for child 21 and older .\nThe cost of FT 24/7 care prohibitive and the distance between his doctors always problematic .\nAt the Center for Discovery , my son lives in a safe and stimulating community of disabled young adults .\nHalf of his day is spent in a classroom learning better communication and self-care skills and the rest of the day is spent \u00bc mile away working in the horse barn , sorting produce , recycling , even stacking hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home setting can replicate this .\nMost importantly , there is a medical facility for people with special needs a mile away .\nLiving in a special needs community is not for every child with autism .\nBut sometimes , it is clearly the best choice for the child .\nDr Johnson needs to understand this .\nThis IACC meeting was a perfect illustration of how the selection process for IACC has gone wrong , really wrong !\nThe NIH needs to choose leaders of actual organizations ( The National Autism Assoc.\n, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , people who really represent part of the community .\nI guarantee that 99 % of parents of kids and adults with profound autism would have been incensed by the way Ms. Singer was treated .\nI greatly admire her courage for speaking out on behalf of those with profound autism .\nParents of kids and adults with profound autism would also be furious at Dr. Gordon for creating and autism committee that left out half the spectrum .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland \u2019 s death rates tripled , for about 15 days , until Switzerland reintroduced HCQ .\nCOVID deaths then fell back to their baseline .\nSwitzerland \u2019 s \u201c natural experiment \u201d had provided yet another potent argument for HCQ \u2026 A meta-review of 58 observational studies by physician researchers in Spain , Italy , France , and Saudi Arabia found that HCQ dramatically reduced mortality from COVID , while additional articles by doctors in Turkey , Canada , and the US found that HCQ \u2019 s cardiac toxicity is negligible .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that , \u201c The mortality rate from COVID-19 in countries that allow access to HCQ is only one-tenth the mortality rate in countries where there is interference with this medication , such as the United States \u2026 In some areas of Central America , officials are even going door to door to distribute HCQ \u2026 these countries have been successful in limiting the mortality from COVID-19 to only a fraction of what it is in wealthier countries.\n\u201d On page 37 , Kennedy covers the remarkable success of IVM : \u201c By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had discovered another COVID remedy that equaled HCQ in its staggering , life-saving efficacy .\nFive years earlier , two Merck scientists won the Nobel Prize for developing IVM , a drug with unprecedented firepower against a wide range of human parasites , including roundworm , hookworm , river blindness , and lymphatic filariasis .\nThat salute was the Nobel Committee \u2019 s only award to an infectious disease medication in 60 years .\nFDA approved IVM as safe and effective for human use in 1996. WHO includes IVM ( along with HCQ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicines \u201d \u2026 Millions of people have consumed billions of IVM doses as an anti-parasitic , with minimal side effects \u201d On page 38 , the effectiveness of IVM in preventing COVID-19 is covered : \u201c In Argentina , for example , in the summer of 2020 , Dr. Hector Carvallo conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial of IVM as a preventive , finding 100 percent efficacy against COVID-19 .\nCarvallo \u2019 s team found no infections in 788 workers who took weekly IVM prophylaxis , whereas 58 percent of the 407 controls had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Restricts IVM , Other Countries Are Increasing Its Use On pages 42 and 43 , the contrast in the use of IVM in other countries compared to the U.S. is presented : \u201c Today , as Dr. Fauci moves the U.S. to eliminate all use of IVM , other countries are using more of it .\nIn February 2021 , the head of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association held a press conference to call for adding IVM to its outpatient treatment protocol .\nSeveral Indian states had added IVM to their list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia \u2019 s government not only authorized the use of the drug but also created a website showing real-time availability \u2026 El Salvador distributes IVM for free to all of its citizens .\nNations where residents have easy access to IVM invariably see immediate and dramatic declines in COVID deaths .\nHospitals in Indonesia started using IVM on July 22 , 2021 .\nBy the first week of August , cases and deaths were plummeting \u2026 New Delhi , India was experiencing a COVID epidemic crisis .\nThe state government obliterated 97 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On pages 52 and 53 , Dr. Lawrie began by endorsing the miraculous efficacy of IVM : \u201c Had IVM been employed in 2020 when medical colleagues around the world first alerted the authorities to its efficacy , millions of lives could have been saved , and the pandemic with all its associated suffering and loss brought to a rapid and timely end \u2026 The story of IVM has highlighted that we are at a remarkable juncture in medical history .\nThe tools that we use to heal our patients are being systematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed .\nThe story of IVM shows that we as a public have misplaced our trust in the authorities and have underestimated the extent to which money and power corrupts \u2026 Dr. Lawrie called out the corruption of modern medicine by Big Pharma and other interests and attributed the barbaric suppression of IVM to the single-minded obsession with more profitable vaccines.\n\u201d IVM Works Great/Can \u2019 t Have That/Got to Do Something Dr. Pierre Kory is the former Chief of the Critical Care Service and Medical Director of the Trauma and Life Support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On page 54 , his testimony before the Senate and what happened next will shock you .\n\u201c When Dr. Kory \u2019 s explosive December 8 , 2020 Senate testimony describing the peer-reviewed science supporting IVM went viral , prescriptions for IVM from U.S. doctors exploded .\nAmericans were getting legitimate prescriptions filled at pharmacies , up to 88,000 scripts in a single week .\nThe truth of the drug \u2019 s benefits was going viral , and the last thing Dr. Fauci et al could tolerate was an effective treatment for COVID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government moved aggressively to block its use \u2026 You Tube soon scrubbed Kory \u2019 s video and Facebook blocked him .\nThen in March 2021 the U.S. FDA , the European Medical Association ( EMA ) , and the WHO issued statements advising against the use of IVM for COVID-19 \u2026 On July 18 , 2021 a front-page Wall Street Journal headline asked , \u201c Why is the FDA Attacking a Safe , Effective Drug ?\n\u201d On August 16 , 2021 , two weeks after the Wall Street Journal article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\n( Is it clear yet ? )\nOn pages 63-70 : \u201c Anthony Fauci needed to use all his moxie and all his esoteric maneuvers mastered during his half-century at NIH , to win FDA \u2019 s approval for his vanity drug , Remdesivir .\nRemdesivir has no clinical efficacy against COVID-19 according to every legitimate study .\nWorse , it is deadly poisonous and expensive , an expensive poison at $ 3,000 per treatment \u2026 Many doctors believe our country \u2019 s record COVID-19 fatalities are at least in part due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe had the most deaths worldwide says Dr. Ryan Cole .\nIt is a haunting question : How many of these Americans were remdesivir casualties ?\nDr. Peter McCullough gives us a stark and clear summary : Remdesivir has two problems .\nFirst , it doesn \u2019 t work .\nSecond , it is toxic and its kills people.\n\u201d VAERS stands for Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System .\nOn page 72 and 73 : \u201c Dr .\nFauci stubbornly refused to fix VAERS which systematically suppresses reporting of most vaccine injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VAERS detects fewer that 1 percent of vaccine injuries .\nPut another way , VAERS misses OVER 99 percent of vaccine injuries , thereby lending the illusion of safety to even the deadliest inoculations .\nIn 2010 , the federal Agency for Health Care Research Quality ( AHRQ ) designed and field-tested a state-of-the-art machine-counting system as an efficient alternative to VAERS .\nBy testing the system for several years on the Harvard Pilgrim HMO , AHRQ proved that it could capture most vaccine injuries .\nAHRQ initially planned to roll out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after seeing the AHRQ \u2019 s frightening results- vaccines were causing serious injuries in 1 of every 40 recipients- CDC killed the project and stowed the new system on a dusty shelf.\n\u201d ( Which entities benefit from drastic undercounting of vaccine injuries and deaths ? )\nOn page 87 and 88 : \u201c Despite CDC \u2019 s efforts to hide the carnage in the U.S. , even the dysfunctional VAERS system has recorded unprecedented waves of documented deaths following COVID vaccines \u2026 Health workers have administered many billions of vaccines during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight months , the COVID vaccines have injured and killed far more Americans than all other vaccines combined over three decades.\n\u201d ( Read this paragraph again and try to take in this shocking truth . )\nThis article presents only a tiny fraction of the enormously important information in the first 100 pages of Kennedy \u2019 s book .\nStay tuned for the nuggets in the next 100 pages soon .\nPart 2 : A Few Nuggets from the New Best-selling Book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr .\nThe Real Anthony Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlights from the second hundred pages of this 445-page book .\nReaders are encouraged to use the page references to read before and after the quotes to put things in context and to track down the references if more information is desired .\nMy comments will appear in parentheses .\n\u2022 Regulatory agencies have been captured by the pharmaceutical industry they are supposed to regulate .\nThe result is a relationship that greatly benefits Big Pharma and harms the public .\n\u2022 Safe , effective , and inexpensive medicines for early treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made unavailable in the U.S. while several other countries are saving many lives using these same medicines .\nWhy ?\nBecause these medicines ( HCQ and IVM ) would compete with COVID-19 vaccines and favored COVID medicines that generate big profits .\n\u2022 The deadly , expensive , and ineffective drug Remdesivir has been promoted as the favored COVID-19 treatment in hospitals .\n\u2022 VAERS is intentionally ineffective at identifying vaccine injuries and deaths .\nEfforts to improve VAERS have been blocked .\n\u2022 Fauci has been deeply involved in all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we realize that his first priority is to do whatever is best for Big Pharma .\nMore on this topic in Part 2 .\nOn page 122 , Kennedy describes what has happened : \u201c Dr .\nFauci has done almost nothing to advance NIAID \u2019 s core obligation of researching the causes of the devastating explosions in epidemics of chronic allergic and autoimmune diseases that , under his tenure , have mushroomed to affect 54 percent of children , up from 12.8 percent when he took charge of NIAID in 1984 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Fauci has instead reshaped NIAID into the leading incubator for new pharmaceutical products , many of which , ironically , profit from the cascading chronic disease pandemic.\n\u201d Kennedy describes Dr. Fauci \u2019 s main focus on page 122 : \u201c Over the last fifty years at NIH , Dr. Fauci has played a leading role in Big Pharma \u2019 s engineered demolition of American health and democracy , working hand in glove with pharmaceutical companies to overcome federal regulatory obstacles and transform the NIH and NIAID into a single-minded vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of patented pharmaceutical products , including vaccines and vaccine-like products.\n\u201d Were Vaccines Responsible for the Drastic Decline in Infectious Disease Mortality ?\nThe answer is no .\nOn page 129 , Kennedy provides the evidence : An exhaustive 2000 study by CDC and Johns Hopkins scientists published in Pediatrics , the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics , concluded , \u201c Thus vaccination does not account for the impressive declines in infectious disease mortality seen in the first half of the [ 20th ] century \u2026 nearly 90 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. children occurred before 1940 , when few antibiotics or vaccines were available.\n\u201d What Did Cause the Drastic Decline in Infectious Disease Mortality ?\nAlso , on page 129 , the answer is clear : The CDC and a 1977 study by McKinlay and McKinlay found : \u201c Both CDC and the McKinlays attributed the disappearance of infectious disease mortalities not to doctors and health officials , but to improved nutrition and sanitation\u2014the latter credited to strict regulation of food preparation , electric refrigerators , sewage treatment , and chlorinated water .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious disease pioneer , Edward Kass , in warning that a self-serving medical cartel would one day try to claim credit for these public health improvements as a pretense for imposing unwarranted medical interventions ( e.g.\n, vaccines ) on the American public.\n\u201d ( That prediction was totally accurate .\nMost of the public now believes that the vaccines were the saviors because that lie has been repeated ad nauseum . )\n\u201c As the McKinlays and Kass had predicted , vaccinologists successfully hijacked the astonishing success story \u2013 the dramatic 74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half of the twentieth century \u2013 and deployed it to claim for themselves and particularly for vaccines , a revered and sanctified \u2013 and scientifically undeserving -- prestige beyond criticism , questioning , or debate.\n\u201d ( The winners were better nutrition \u2013 fresh fruits and vegetables available year-round \u2013 and substantial improvements in sanitation .\nThese factors were responsible for reducing infectious disease mortality to near zero .\nThe claim that vaccines caused this decrease is false but is widely promoted by Big Pharma . )\n1976 : The Fake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 131 : \u201c That year federal regulators concocted a fake swine flu epidemic that temporarily raised hopes around CDC for the resurrection of its reputation as a life-saving superhero \u2026 But the swine flu pandemic was a dud , and HHS \u2019 s response was a global embarrassment .\nOnly one casualty \u2013 a soldier at Fort Dix \u2013 succumbed to the \u201c pandemic , \u201d and Merck \u2019 s experimental vaccine triggered a national epidemic of Guillain-Barre \u2019 syndrome , a devastating form of paralysis resembling polio , before regulators recalled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment in which Mike Wallace mercilessly exposed the corruption , incompetence , and cover-ups at HHS that led to the phony swine flu pandemic and the wave of casualties from NIH \u2019 s experimental vaccine .\nThe scandal forced the resignation of CDC Director David Sencer for his role in concocting the phony pandemic and pushing the dangerous vaccine.\n\u201d Azidothymidine , known as AZT , was originally developed as a chemotherapy drug to treat leukemia .\nThe story of AZT and how it came to be an AIDS drug is told on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic chemotherapy compound after it proved ineffective against cancer and breathtakingly lethal in mice .\nGovernment researchers deemed it too toxic even for short-term regimen cancer chemotherapy.\n\u201d After HIV was identified as the probable cause of AIDS , Dr. Fauci began to promote AZT as a possible AIDS drug .\n\u201c But it did not go smoothly \u2026 AZT \u2019 s horrendous toxicity hobbled researchers struggling to design study protocols that would make it appear either safe or effective.\n\u201d Meanwhile , \u201c Community doctors were achieving promising results with off-label therapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of symptoms that actually killed and tormented people with AIDS \u2026 Despite years of pleading by the HIV community , Dr. Fauci refused to test any of those repurposed drugs.\n\u201d One of NCI \u2019 s top virologists , Dr. Frank Ruscetti had this to say : \u201c We could have saved millions of lives with repurposed and therapeutic drugs .\nBut there \u2019 s no profit in it .\nIt \u2019 s all got to be about newly patented antivirals and their mischievous vaccines.\n\u201d The movie \u201c Dallas Buyers Club \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time in history .\nMelisa Wallack and Craig Borten received Oscar nominations for their script .\nPage 152-153 picks up the story : \u201c Dr .\nFauci \u2019 s campaign to sabotage therapeutic remedies played a key role in precipitating the emergence of the underground medical network .\nSo-called \u201c Buyers Clubs \u201d filled the vacuum by providing treatments that community doctors and their patients considered effective against AIDS , but that FDA refused to approve .\n\u201c Dr .\nFauci was a liar.\n\u201d Recalls Wallack , who researched Dr. Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was utterly beholden to pharmaceutical companies and was hostile to any product that would compete with AZT .\nHe was the real villain of this era .\nHe cost a lot of people their lives.\n\u201d One of the most promising AIDS drugs was AL 721 .\nHere is the story on page 160 : \u201c AIDS activists afterward learned that at the same time Dr. Fauci was telling them and Senator Kennedy \u2019 s office that he was finally testing AL 721 , Teflon Tony was confiding to his Pharma Pls [ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AL 721 studies to fail .\n\u201c I wanted to debunk it , \u201d he assured them .\nJust as he would do with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID crisis thirty years later , he designed his AL 721 clinical trials in a way that would ensure their failure and thus discredit the unpatentable medicine.\n\u201d ( It is difficult not to feel a sense of deja-vu when we see that the same actions and tactics used during the early AIDS crisis are eerily repeated during the ongoing COVID crisis . )\nTemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On page 172-173 : \u201c His success at using the AIDS crisis to bring a deadly , toxic , and ineffective AIDS drug to market taught Dr. Fauci some key career lessons that he would faithfully repeat again and again throughout his long regime .\nDuring his battle to win FDA approval for AZT , Dr. Fauci pioneered the strategy upon which he would build his career and then showcase for the world during the COVID epidemic.\n\u201d Kennedy then lists 30 bullet points detailing how this strategy was carried out .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy covers the ongoing controversy on the relationship of HIV and AIDS .\nThere are many people with AIDS who don \u2019 t have HIV in their blood and there are many people with HIV who never develop AIDS .\nThere seems to be much more to AIDS than just HIV .\nMore on the HIV/AIDS hypothesis will be covered in Part 3 .\nI have covered a tiny fraction of the material in the second hundred pages of this fantastic 445-page book .\nFor those interested in this subject , the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by page cover to cover reading .\nI hope to cover the rest of the book in two more articles .\nAbout the author : Dr. William H. Gaunt is a retired Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine .\nHe is a graduate of the University of South Florida in Tampa .\nHe was a U. S. Navy helicopter pilot and later an instructor pilot for the Iranian Navy and the Saudi Arabian Air Force before attending medical school at Bastyr University near Seattle , Washington .\nDr. Gaunt graduated with honors in 1983 .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and anatomy at high school and college levels and published several articles related to vaccines .\nDr. Gaunt and his wife have a blended family of eight boys plus a girl adopted from China .\nContact information for the author : billandsusan830 @ gmail.com Part 3 Part 3 : A Few Nuggets from the New Best-selling Book by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A small fraction of the information in the third hundred pages is covered here .\nReaders are encouraged to read before and after the selected quotes to put things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of each chapter for additional information .\nMy comments will appear in parentheses .\n\u2022 Fauci \u2019 s NIAID ignores chronic allergic and autoimmune diseases which have greatly increased on his watch .\n( Vaccine ingredients cause many of these allergic and autoimmune diseases . )\n\u2022 Fauci \u2019 s main focus is developing and promoting very profitable drugs .\nHe is Big Pharma \u2019 s BFF .\n\u2022 Incontrovertible evidence shows that vaccines were not responsible for the huge drop in mortality from infectious diseases .\n\u2022 Improvements in nutrition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall to near zero BEFORE most vaccines were introduced .\n\u2022 AZT is horrendously toxic , very expensive , and ineffective against AIDS .\n\u2022 Studies of inexpensive and highly effective medicines for AIDS and COVID-19 have been designed to fail .\nThe results of these fraudulent studies are then used as justification for suppressing their use and making them unavailable to doctors and the public .\nWhat is a good word for deliberately denying life-saving medicines to sick people ?\nHint : It starts with an \u201c m \u201d .\nThe HIV/AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multi-billion-dollar industry built on this hypothesis and those who profit from it are not about to admit that it is flawed .\nOn page 209 , a letter written by top international scientists is shown : \u201c It is widely believed by the general public that a retrovirus called HIV causes a group of diseases called AIDS .\nMany biomedical scientists now question this hypothesis .\nWe propose a thorough reappraisal of the existing evidence for and against this hypothesis , to be conducted by a suitable group .\nWe further propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undertaken \u201d \u2026 \u201c But in an early display of Dr. Fauci \u2019 s and Big Pharma \u2019 s combined power to control the medical journals , Nature declined to publish the letter .\nNor would New England Journal of Medicine , JAMA , or The Lancet .\nThese journals rely on the pharmaceutical industry for upward of 90 percent of their revenues and seldom publish studies that threaten the Pharma paradigm .\nAs Lancet editor Richard Horton has observed , \u201c The journals have developed into information laundering operations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Luc Montagnier , the French scientist who won a Nobel prize for isolating HIV is quoted : \u201c The HIV virus is harmless and passive , a benign virus.\n\u201d ( Profits are more important than people or scientific accuracy . )\nIf HIV Doesn \u2019 t Cause AIDS , What Does ?\nIt turns out that multiple things may cause AIDS individually or in combination : ( 1 ) Heavy recreational drug use is strongly corelated with weakening the immune system resulting in AIDS .\nThis is discussed on page 221 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another possible culprit is discussed : \u201c After 1987 , Dr. Duesberg and his followers argue , the vast majority of \u201c AIDS deaths \u201d were actually caused by AZT\u2014Dr .\nFauci \u2019 s radical \u201c antiretroviral \u201d chemotherapy purposely concocted to kill human cells .\nDuesberg describes the syndrome as \u201c AIDS by AZT.\n\u201d Ironically , he argued AZT , the highly toxic medication that Dr. Fauci was prescribing to treat AIDS patients , actually does what the virus can not \u2014that is , it causes AIDS itself.\n\u201d The cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star Authur Ashe are discussed on page 227 .\nBoth died of AIDS after taking AZT .\nAshe followed his doctor \u2019 s advice in taking a very high dose of AZT even though he had misgivings .\nNureyev ignored his doctor \u2019 s warnings about the deadly effects of AZT and insisted on taking it .\n( 3 ) On page 235 , a bacterium-like organism called mycoplasma is discussed as another possible cause of AIDS .\n( 4 ) Additional causes of AIDS may be discovered in the future .\nWhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally Proven Wrong ?\nOn page 237 , Dr. Harvey Bialy is quoted : \u201c \u2026It is not much of an exaggeration to state that when the HIV/AIDS hypothesis is finally recognized as wrong , the entire institution of science will lose the public \u2019 s trust and science itself will experience fundamental , profound , and long-lasting changes .\nThe scientific community has risked its credibility by standing by the HIV theory for so long .\nThis is why doubting the HIV hypothesis is now tantamount to doubting science itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On pages 245-248 , some of the details of these unconscionable experiments are explained : \u201c In 2004 , investigative journalist Liam Scheff chronicled Dr. Fauci \u2019 s secretive experiments on hundreds of HIV-positive foster children at Incarnation Children \u2019 s Center ( ICC ) in New York City and numerous sister facilities in New York and six other states between 1988 and 2002 .\n[ It turns out that not all of these children were HIV-positive . ]\nThose experiments were the core of Dr. Fauci \u2019 s career-defining effort to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an encore to AZT.\n\u201d \u201c Scheff described how Dr. Fauci \u2019 s NIAID and his Big Pharma partners turned Black and Hispanic foster kids into lab rats , subjected to torture and abuse in a grim parade of unsupervised drug and vaccine studies \u2026 Dr. Fauci had the safety oversight board rigged with his loyal PIs [ Principal Investigators ] , foremost of whom was Dr. Stephen Nicholas , a generously funded NIAID AIDS researcher \u2026 The drugs being given to the children are toxic\u2014they \u2019 re known to cause genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , bodily deformations , brain damage , and fatal skin disorders \u2026 If the children refuse the drugs , they \u2019 re held down and force fed .\nIf the children continue to resist , they \u2019 re taken to Columbia Presbyterian hospital , where a surgeon puts a plastic tube through their abdominal wall into their stomachs .\nFrom then on the drugs are injected directly into their intestines.\n\u201d ( This is so sickening that many people would doubt that such evil could actually have happened , but it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . )\n\u201c Vera Sharav spent years investigating Dr. Fauci \u2019 s torture chambers as part of her lifelong mission to end cruel medical experimentation on children .\nSharav told me , \u201c Fauci just brushed all those dead babies under the rug.\n\u201d Sharav said that at least eighty children died in Dr. Fauci \u2019 s Manhattan concentration camp and accused NIAID and its partners of disposing of children \u2019 s remains in mass graves.\n\u201d BBC \u2019 s heartbreaking documentary \u201c Guinea Pig Kids , \u201d chronicles the savage barbarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perspective of the affected children .\nThat year , BBC hired investigative reporter Celia Farber to conduct field research for the film , which exposes the dark underside of Big Pharma \u2019 s stampede to develop lucrative new AIDS remedies .\n\u201c I found the mass grave at Gate of Heaven cemetery in Hawthorne , New York , \u201d she told me .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t believe my eyes .\nIt was a very large pit with Astroturf thrown over it , which you could actually lift up .\nUnder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden coffins , haphazardly stacked .\nThere may have been 100 of them .\nI learned there were more than one child \u2019 s body in each .\nAround the pit was a semi-circle of several large tombstones on which upward of one thousand children \u2019 s names had been engraved .\nI wrote down every name.\n\u201d ( \u201c Guinea Pig Kids \u201d and related documentaries are still on YouTube , but they could be disappeared at any time .\nThey are a \u201c must watch \u201d for those interested in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one titled \u201c Silent Epidemic \u201d which is 25:45 in length tells the sad story of a foster couple who took in two half-sisters .\nThe girls were experiencing neurological and emotional symptoms .\nThey stopped the medications and the girls blossomed into happy and healthy children , but the authorities took the girls back and actually convicted the foster mom of child abuse for stopping the toxic medications .\nThere was definitely child abuse involved but it was not being done by the foster mom . )\nAt Least Fourteen Thousand Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unethical Experiments On page 252 : \u201c During the decades since Dr. Fauci took over NIAID , he has sanctioned drug companies to experiment on at least fourteen thousand children , many of them Black and Hispanic orphans living in foster homes .\nHe permitted these companies to operate without oversight or accountability .\nUnder Dr. Fauci \u2019 s laissez faire rubric , these companies systematically abused and occasionally killed children.\n\u201d How to Cheat on Safety Trials of Highly Toxic Drugs Historically , scientific studies on drugs would have an experimental group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a control group that got some harmless pill called a placebo .\nIf the drug was toxic , it would show very clearly with many more injuries and deaths in the experimental group .\nDrug companies that wanted to make a toxic drug appear less toxic came up with a clever way to cheat .\nOn page 259 : \u201c When they can get away with it .\nPharma researchers commonly employ the highly unethical gimmick of eliminating the placebo control group in order to mask injuries in the study group .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ group allows PhD grifters to dismiss all injuries and deaths in the study group as sad coincidences not associated with the drug they are testing .\n( The researchers make sure that the \u201c control group \u201d gets something as toxic as the drug being tested instead of a harmless placebo .\nThis assures that injuries and deaths in both groups are similar and can then be disregarded .\nThis is a diabolical and fraudulent experimental method which has been used to get many dangerous drugs approved . )\nExample of Blatant Cheating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A drug named Nevirapine was promoted as a way to prevent HIV-positive pregnant women from passing HIV to their babies .\nThe story of this drug is told on pages 259 -274 .\nThe original protocol for a clinical trial in Uganda called for an inert placebo control group , but the placebo group was scrapped and the \u201c control group \u201d got Dr. Fauci \u2019 s horrendously dangerous chemotherapy/AIDS concoction AZT .\nThis study was published in the Lancet as successful , but the fine print showed that 16 babies died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the AZT group .\nI doubt the mothers of these dead babies would characterize this clinical trial as successful .\nIt turned out that Nevirapine went on to kill many African mothers and babies and proved ineffective at preventing the passing of HIV from pregnant women to their babies .\nOn page 274 : \u201c And the real losers in that battle , added Farber [ investigative journalist ] were the millions of African women and babies forced to take Nevirapine , a drug that does not prevent AIDS but sickens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , Dr. Fauci succeeded in rigging corrupt clinical trials , concealing catastrophic cheating , and deftly manipulating the politics to bring his dangerous and ineffective drug , Nevirapine , to market.\n\u201d Where Did the COVID-19 Virus Come From ?\nProminent Virologists Have Been Lavishly Rewarded for Saying It Must Have Come from Nature .\nOn page 297 : \u201c \u2026When revelations that the COVID-19 virus was likely the product of genetic engineering , threatened to discredit his empire , Tony Fauci dispatched the handpicked elite of virology \u2019 s officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorials published in Nature and The Lancet in February and March of 2020 assuring the world that the lab leak hypothesis was a \u201c crackpot \u201d conspiracy.\n\u201d ( Those scientists who joined in to crush the idea of a lab leak have been rewarded with huge grants for their research .\nLoyalty to Dr. Fauci pays off .\nRecent information indicates that the lab leak theory is likely correct . )\nLeaders of Several Countries Who Opposed the COVID-19 Vaccines Died Suddenly On page 308 , Kennedy writes : \u201c While unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , an eyebrow-raising number of anti-vax political leaders were simultaneously expiring in Africa

this quote in Part 3 . )\n\u2022 The evidence points to AIDS being multifactorial and not a simple matter of HIV being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic drugs on thousands of orphans is morally wrong .\nMany of these children were seriously injured and some were killed .\nDr. Fauci was in charge .\n\u2022 A deplorable part of science being used by Dr. Fauci and his researchers involves blatant cheating in order to get very toxic drugs approved .\nThe trick is to get rid of the control group which gets a harmless placebo and replace it with a \u201c control group \u201d which gets something as toxic as the drug being tested .\nThis will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deaths in both groups and the researchers then claim that these injuries and deaths are not caused by the toxic drug being tested .\n\u2022 A major effort was made to discredit the science pointing to COVID-19 being a gain-of-function engineered virus that escaped from the Wuhan lab in China .\nScientists who joined Dr. Fauci in this effort were richly rewarded with multi-million-dollar research grants .\n\u2022 It is totally unacceptable for any country to opt out of the COVID-19 vaccines .\nSeveral leaders of countries who tried to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders who then welcomed these vaccines .\n( Important details can be found on page 308 . )\nDTP Vaccine Discontinued in the U.S. , Europe , and Japan On pages 324-325

evidence of its deadly impacts.\n\u201d How Deadly Is the DTP Vaccine in African Girls ?\nOn page 325-326 : \u201c Prior to 2017 , neither HHS nor WHO had performed the kind of study necessary to ascertain whether the DTP vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about which Gates [ Bill ] frequently boasts.\n\u201d A large study was done that year of all-cause mortality after DTP inoculations .\n\u201c That massive study put the lie to Gates \u2019 s mantric [ sic ] incantation that his investment in the DTP vaccine has saved millions of lives .\nIn June 2017 , the team published a peer-reviewed study in EBioMedicine , a high-gravitas journal in Elsevier \u2019 s publishing house armada .\nThe article parsed data from a so-called \u201c natural experiment \u201d in Guinea-Bissau where half the

children \u2026 At least seven other studies have confirmed DTP \u2019 s association with high mortality in vaccinated girls compared to unvaccinated .\nThe idealistic Americans who donated to Gates \u2019 s African vaccine project\u2014believing they were saving African babies\u2014were actually funding a continent-wide female genocide.\n\u201d ( Vaccines imposed on children in poor countries

Alarmed at the exploding epidemics of neurodevelopmental , allergic , and autoimmune diseases in children that began in 1986 , CDC commenced in 1999 an in-house study of the vast repository of health

Datalink data . )\nLet \u2019 s Give These Toxic Mercury-containing Vaccines to Children in Poor Countries Just Like We Did With DTP On page 328 : \u201c Despite the discontinuance in Western nations , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to force African children to submit to a battery of potentially dangerous mercury-laced vaccines .\nStrong evidence suggests that African boys with high levels of

the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease mortality to near zero as they did in the U.S. before most of the vaccines were introduced . )\nSterility Vaccines Given to African Women Without Their Knowledge or Consent On page 336 : \u201c On November 6 , 2014 , four years after Gates pledged at a TED Talk to use vaccines to lower birth rates , medical researchers and doctors associated with the Kenya Conference of

Four years later in October 2019 , The Kenyan Doctors \u2019 Association accused UNICEF , GAVI , and the WHO of rendering millions of women and girls barren .\nThe doctors had by then produced

"content": "The New York Times followed up with a scathing hit piece targeting Kennedy as \u201c a leading voice in the campaign to discredit coronavirus vaccines and other measures being advanced by the Biden White House to battle a pandemic that was\u2026killing close to 1,900 people a day.\n\u201d It accused him of circulating \u201c false information , \u201d without indicating what that information is or explaining why it \u2019 s false , and of comparing the government pandemic response to the Holocaust , even though he clearly didn \u2019 t do that .\nIn support of their interests , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens , it censored The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. is becoming a legitimate folk hero.\n\u201d He is a folk hero because he stood up , grabbed a bullhorn , and spoke truth to power .\nHe \u2019 s risked everything and lost a lot .\nHe \u2019 s realized that you either care about justice or you care about personal consequences .\nAnd for him there have been many .\nAfter suppressing freedom of speech for two years , after defending a specific , myopic and harmful narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Times decided it was the perfect time to take a strong stance against censorship and cancel culture .\nThe irony of the most powerful and impactful violator of First Amendment rights lamenting the lack of free speech and offering up ideas to protect the rights of Americans was palpable , inescapable , and despicable .\nLike Captain Renault in the movie Casablanca , when he closes Rick \u2019 s Caf\u00e9 Americain and proclaims : \u201c I \u2019 m shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here \u201d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s winnings .\nTheir profitability has soared during the worst and most pervasive period of censorship in recent American history .\nThey have done absolutely nothing to protect the free speech rights of hundreds , if not thousands , of doctors , nurses , scientists , and concerned citizens who have tried to discuss views , make arguments , and analyze scientific studies that challenge the prevailing Covid narrative .\nThey have silenced debate , worked tirelessly to chastise , vilify , and discredit those whose positions they disagree with , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption .\nNevertheless , they claim to lament that \u201c when public discourse in America is narrowed , it becomes harder to answer\u2026the urgent questions we face as a society.\n\u201d What could be more important , more urgent , than the truth about corruption at the highest levels of government , about a pandemic response that led to more serious illness and death than was necessary , about the most powerful public health official in the country being more concerned with helping Big Pharma maximize return on investment and mitigate risk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , the worst kind of censorship is cancel culture and the worst kind of cancel culture is the \u201c piling on \u201d kind .\nWhy then , one might ask , did the NYT run a hit piece about Robert F.

Kennedy Jr \u2019 s book and his allegations of corruption against Dr. Anthony Fauci .\nIt defended Dr. Fauci without any investigation , without a full , free and fair discussion of what is clearly the most important book of the decade .\nBy ignoring Kennedy \u2019 s book , by refusing to review it , by not allowing advertisements , by misrepresenting its success on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its power to avoid any debate whatsoever about the real science behind the origins of Covid or the best practices for controlling the virus and protecting the public .\nThe New York Times has shown a total disregard for the scientific process , individual due process rights , or for any real search for truth .\nAnd , once again , it did all this while lecturing us about the importance of free speech .\nWe have arrived at Orwell \u2019 s 1984 .\nDoublespeak is the universal language .\nThe paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , claims to be working tirelessly to protect the American people , and has clearly become The Ministry of Truth .\nReading Robert F.

non-verbal 40 , 50 and 60 year olds who are still in diapers and have to be protected from harming themselves and others ?\nWhere are the middle aged/elderly Americans who were normally developing as babies and who inexplicably lost learned skills and regressed into autism ?\nStill waiting for that science to come out Meanwhile I \u2019 m currently seeing stories that claim adults have autism at the same rate we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,437,988 or 2.21 % of adults and 1 in 44 children in the United States have autism and are somewhere on the spectrum , according to the Centers for Disease Control and

estimates that 2.2 % of Americans adults have an autism spectrum condition .\nThat adds up to 5.4 million people age 18 and older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said

in this film , but what was most intriguing were the comments on what the autism numbers really are and what we \u2019 re going to have to deal with in the not-too-distant future .\nI transcribed the entire film , but I wanted to share the parts that truly spell disaster .\nDr. Walter Zahorodny says that he \u2019 s has been working on autism since 2000 , and he \u2019 s responsible for the New Jersey autism numbers , considered the most accurate in the country at one in every 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his views have a lot of credibility .\nIt \u2019 s a film about autism .\nIt focuses on the very real increase in the rate of autism and what a lot of experts have to say about it .\nIncluded are interviews by Smith with people like Dr. David Amaral , Research Director at UC Davis MIND Institute , Rick Rollens , Former Secretary of the California State Senate , Co-Founder of the U.C .\nDavis M.I.N.D .\nInstitute , and autism lobbyist in California , Sheri Marino , to Autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism Healthcare collaborative ) , Dr. Walter Zahorodny , Director of the New Jersey Autism Study and the leading researcher for the CDC \u2019 s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network ( ADDM ) .\nEvery once in a while a film comes with really stunning information from very credible sources .\nThat \u2019 s how I would describe the release of a documentary called , The Missing Piece produced by Michael Smith , Executive Director Foundation for Autism Information and Research .\nSenior CDC autism researcher sounds alarm over the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is among children with the \u201c highest level of impairment , \u201d and he explains how the agency plans to cover up the numbers Advocacy , Policy and Legislation , CDC and the escalating prevalence rates of autism Adult Transition and Services Co-occurring Medical Conditions Autism Insurance The Autism Financial Crisis Autism The Missing Piece : A non partisan documentary addressing the challenges and financial crisis of autism spectrum disorders in The United States .\nWatch below or on YouTube https : //youtu.be/2uSsVjJbH0I or at Fair Autism Media Zahorodny begins his comments by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in children today is simply the result of better diagnosing .\nI \u2019 m always struck by the fact that people think the prevalence is increasing because we \u2019 re just getting better at identifying subtly affected children .\nThat \u2019 s definitely not the case .\nAutism is going up and has increased significantly across every group that we look at : boys and girls , black , white , Hispanic , Asian , all up significantly .\nChildren from rich communities and poor towns , up significantly .\nZahorodny goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s happening , using terms like tsunami , crisis and epidemic , words we \u2019 ve never heard from officials at the CDC .\nAnd not only are the increases real , but the biggest increase is in children with the most severe form of autism .\nInterestingly enough , we \u2019 ve seen the widest or the broadest increase among the children who have the highest level of impairment of autism , not the subtle , mild levels of impairment .\nSo I do consider escalating autism prevalence to be a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , epidemic is a clich\u00e9 .\nPeople talk about it in many different ways .\nThe public \u2019 s not sensitive to that term anymore .\nIf there \u2019 s a stronger term , I \u2019 d be in favor of using it .\nBut when we saw autism prevalence go from one to two percent , nobody objected or seemed concerned , and now we \u2019 ve gone from two percent to three percent , and I also see no significant concern or urgency .\nOn the other hand , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last 10 and 15 years , and I \u2019 m a little bit concerned why nobody really sees this tsunami right there in front of us .\nWe saw a very significant rise in prevalence between the 2012 and 2014 cycle .\nIt was over 25 percent in a 2 year period .\nThat \u2019 s very significant .\nBecause of his research , Zahorodny is sure the autism numbers for the U.S. are worse than what the CDC admits to .\nYou can \u2019 t understand what has to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are affected .\nAnd this is the beginning .\nThis is the way that you appreciate the scope of the problem .\nWe know , we do surveillance in Essex , Hudson and Union Counties .\nThey \u2019 re part of the New York metropolitan region , and if our rate is three percent , I would bet that the rate in all of your suburban , urban New York counties would be the same .\nOne of the most compelling epidemiological studies that I \u2019 ve seen in recent history is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey showing that 4.4 percent of the boys in the State of New Jersey now have an autism spectrum disorder .\nWhat is troubling about that study is the fact that we know that not all of these kids are diagnosed by age four , and the real rates could be as high as six percent .\nIf we look at the fact of how many of these kids have an intellectual disability or nonverbal , we could be looking at a situation in New Jersey right now where three percent of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be non-verbal and have an intellectual disability , the term we use now instead of mental retardation .\nSo that \u2019 s very troubling , and I \u2019 m really concerned why other states are not making epidemiological studies a major priority so that they can manage the crisis that they have upon them in their states right now .\nZahorodny actually accuses the CDC of ignoring the autism disaster along with the media .\nFor some reason , the CDC has been very effective in massaging the message in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bullet point or two , invariably winds up being repeated almost verbatim in the leading press reports , and then everybody else copies those .\nI find that there \u2019 s very little independent investigation by the media .\n\u2026 \u2026 they don \u2019 t really know how to address the problem .\nI \u2019 m certain that people there understand the magnitude and the scope of the crisis , but if you don \u2019 t have any way of explaining it to the public , it \u2019 s embarrassing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve seen autism , a significant developmental disorder , rise 200 percent and we don \u2019 t know why that is .\nI can say that because I \u2019 m not a public health authority , but if one of my main responsibilities was trying to project a sense of confidence and authority , I wouldn \u2019 t be repeating that I don \u2019 t understand why an important problem is occurring .\nFinally Zahorodny reveals what can only be seen as a sinister plan coming from the CDC .\nInstead of addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a multi-billion dollar institution , they \u2019 re plotting to cover it all up by changing the counting method .\n\u2026we were surprised , or at least I was surprised a week or two ago when we had a webinar with the CDC during which all the investigators that are going to continue doing surveillance were notified that the methodology is going to be changing and changing , I \u2019 d say , rather dramatically .\nInstead of really doing active case finding going forward , the CDC now wants us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an autism diagnosis by age eight .\nThat \u2019 s a lot simpler .\nIt \u2019 s a lot more efficient , but it \u2019 s going to give us no information about the expression of autism , and it will certainly suppress the estimate of autism prevalence .\nMy co-investigator took a look at this a few days ago , and she found that if we used the new , the proposed methodology in 2014 , instead of the traditional active case finding methodology , our rate wouldn \u2019 t have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 per thousand .\nSo there \u2019 s a gigantic difference between two percent and three percent .\nIf the rates are going to be suppressed by 20 to 30 percent under the new methodology , can we expect the CDC to issue press releases next year saying , that the prevalence rates of autism are going down when we know that they \u2019 re actually still going up , but they \u2019 ve just changed the methodology ?\nZahorodny : I \u2019 m not so sure that the public health authorities really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably not in New York .\nI don \u2019 t think that they really appreciate the magnitude of the health crisis , but something has to wake those people up because they \u2019 re the ones who can pass the laws and shift the policy decisions so as to be ready to help .\nOther autism experts expressed their fears over the lack of any official action to address the autism crisis .\n[ I ] t \u2019 s the number one public health crisis in our country .\nThere \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level that when we \u2019 re adding one new child every 42 minutes in the State of California with autism , something has got to be done\u2026 .\nCalifornia is really under the gun .\nWe \u2019 ve now established waiting lists for services , which has never happened before in our state , because we can \u2019 t pay providers the rate that they need to stay in business to serve this very challenging population .\nIt \u2019 s a public health crisis because at the rate we \u2019 re going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sustain this .\nThis is a bubble that \u2019 s going to burst .\nWe can \u2019 t afford , as it is , the educational needs and the therapeutic needs and now we have the medical needs on top that we \u2019 re just [ now ] understanding .\nOne slide summed up what the autism price tag will mean for the United States : Within the next decade the projected annual cost of autism will exceed annual cost of social security in the United States Why don \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism is doing to all of us ?\nAnne Dachel

analysis of the use of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents , and it makes the case that the vaccines are neither needed nor safe and have not been proven to be efficacious , partic- ularly when considering the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 , which currently dominates worldwide .\nIn addition to the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU adverse event reporting systems , it also addresses the risk of genotoxicity of the mRNA vaccines , which due to recent experimental evidence of their integration into host cell genomes must be considered urgent .\nSummary This expertise on the use of the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in children and adolescents is divided into three sections , which will deal with the following questions , in order : 1 .\nIs vaccination of children and adolescents against COVID-19 necessary ?\n2 .\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines effective ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...\nThe only possible conclusion from this analysis is that the use of these vaccines in children and adolescents can not be permitted , and that their ongoing use in any and all age groups ought to be stopped immediately .\nRead the full analysis HERE

really complained about how loud he is or how demanding he can be .\nThey have never ever said no , they don \u2019 t want to help .\nWhile I \u2019 m very grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning on them these days , I look to see if I \u2019 ve exhausted others options .\nI \u2019 m very mindful that they \u2019 re growing into independent people with their own individual likes and dislikes .\nThey like being with their friends doing their own thing .\nThey like going out to the movies , or shopping , and to hang out at their friends \u2019 houses , not ours all the time .\nThe help I ask of them \u2013 by being brave when stinging beasties fly in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 m not home , or by spoon-feeding Ronan who can \u2019 t feed himself \u2013 is a lot to ask of them .\nBut they keep giving physical assistance to their brother .\nThey also keep giving moral support to me and my husband as we tackle things that pop up\u2026through air vents and into attics .\nI know their paths will one day see them out of our home and into their own .\nSo for every minute we can spend with Ronan as a family , I find to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a blessing to know that the others haven \u2019 t run away from stuff ( especially the stinky stuff ! )\nas they encounter it .\nAs he grows , and as each of the siblings grow , there \u2019 ll always be something going on in our family .\nI hope and

"title": "Best Of: Frau Koma Returns After Yet Another Mass Shooting", "content": "Over the years , Breggin and other researchers have worked to identify the mechanism by which certain psychopharmaceutical drugs induce violence and suicidality .\nBreggin has described phenomenon such as drug-induced akathisia , an uncontrollable sense of restless inner torment caused by an amphetamine-like and even LSD-like effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI \u2019 s , and has written about prescription drug-induced \u201c intoxication anosognosia \u201d or \u201c medication spellbinding : The previously concealed Prozac trial data Breggin uncovered and exposed in 1987 included cases of child subjects on Prozac who suddenly developed intrusive dreams and visions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates .\nThere were also far more attempted and completed suicides among drug-exposed subjects than in the placebo groups .\nDue to his success in banning forced lobotomy in institutions coupled with efforts to raise the alarm on clinical risks of ECT and psychiatric drugs , Dr. Breggin has been a thorn in the side of industry and its various front organizations since the 1970 \u2019 s .\nAfter Breggin went on Oprah and reported that Eli Lilly \u2019 s own trial data showed that even individuals lacking histories of violence or serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant Prozac and antipsychotics would frequently develop violent ideation or violent psychosis , NAMI claimed that Breggin \u2019 s remarks could cause patients to discontinue their meds .\nFollowing an outpouring of support for Breggin from the international medical reform community , the Maryland licensure board dropped the charges and Breggin prevailed .\nSeventeen years later , the FDA adopted black box warnings for suicide and violence on SSRI antidepressants .\nThe black box warnings are , almost word for word , the precise clinical caveats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Congressional hearings .\nDr. Peter Breggin , the reform psychiatrist and psychopharmaceutical expert who testified on antidepressant-induced psychosis and violence in the Manitoba case , was sued for his medical license in 1987\u2014the very year that Prozac was first mass marketed by Eli Lilly .\nThe charges were filed by the National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI ) , a consumer group which has always lobbied for forced institutionalization and mandated treatment of the mentally ill ( Section 9.2 of NAMI \u2019 s Public Policy Platform ) \u2014including drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently exposed as a long-standing pharmaceutical industry front organization in The New York Times .\nIn September , 2011 , Manitoba judge Robert Heinrichs ruled that a sixteen year old accused of murder would remain in youth court where he faces a maximum sentence of four years rather than the possibility of life without parole in adult court .\nFamily members of the fifteen year old victim were outraged by the ruling , though Heinrichs stated that the accused \u2019 s \u201c basic normalcy now further confirms he no longer poses a risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental deterioration and resulting violence would not have taken place without exposure to Prozac\u2026He has none of the characteristics of a perpetrator of violence.\n\u201d And death and hell were cast

school shootings\u2014 \u201c Frau Koma kommt \u201d \u2014 \u201c Frau Koma is coming.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people taking psychiatric drugs rarely realize how much the drugs are impairing them mentally or emotionally .\nThey often do not recognize that they \u2019 ve become irrational , depressed , angry , or even euphoric since beginning the medication .\nSecond , if they do realize that they are having painful emotional feelings , medication spellbinding causes them to blame their feelings on something other than the drug .\nThey may get angry at their husbands , wives or children , and become abusive .\nOr they might blame themselves and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug effect with their emotional problems and attribute their emotional distress to \u201c mental illness.\n\u201d Third , medication spellbinding makes some people feel that they are doing better than ever when in reality they are doing much worse than ever .\nIn one case , a man who was high on a combination of an antidepressant and a tranquilizer happily went on a daylight robbery spree in his hometown wearing no disguise .\nAnother otherwise ethical citizen happily embezzled money while documenting the details in easily accessible company computer files .\nBoth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world .\nFourth , some people become so medication spellbound that they lose control of themselves and perpetrate horrendously destructive actions .\nMy book opens with the story an otherwise kind and gentle man who became agitated on an antidepressant and drove his car into a policeman to knock him down to get his gun to try to kill himself .\nIn another case , a ten-year-old boy with no history of depression hung himself after taking a prescription stimulant for ADHD .\nHe documented the dreadful unfolding events while speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to journalist and author Robert Whitaker , after the failed suit against Breggin , Eli Lilly\u2014one of NAMI \u2019 s largest corporate sponsors from the group \u2019 s inception\u2014 reputedly began making anonymous donations and guiding media attention to a very different type of organization , a then obscure California religious group called Scientology .\nScientology , as the story goes , didn \u2019 t look the gift horse in the mouth and soon became the symbol of coercive pseudoscientific cults in the US\u2014the \u201c devil \u201d which the drug industry needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil binary and counterpart to the \u201c angel \u201d of its consumer front beneficiaries.Frau Koma only deals in black and white \u2014except when shades of gray are needed to couch moral relativism .\nScientology would not have been chosen as a target because it was the most dangerous alternative religion in that era of high profile violent and suicidal cults .\nBut the group conveniently embodied \u201c anti-psychiatry \u201d : Scientology claimed to offer a form of therapy for mental suffering by way of earthly transcendence and seemed to view organized psychiatry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Scientology offered a drug-free reverse parallel for its own utopian marketing approach , promising the public a future paradise on earth free from disease , pain , suffering , violence and fear in exchange for uncritical faith in commercial science and the wonders of modern chemistry\u2014 while Scientology offered this through commitment to the church \u2019 s rites and practices .\nIn any case , Lilly and Company likely recognized the potential to build up a straw-man target on which to project its own \u201c sins \u201d and as a means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cult smears in the media it sponsors .\nBetween 1988 and 2007 , use of antidepressants in the US has risen by 400 % , a fact which drug proponents claim is due to \u201c increased recognition \u201d of mental illness .\nBut increased prescribing has not brought with it the expected improvement in mental health among Americans : instead , the rate of mental disability has increased nearly two and a half times between 1987 and 2007\u2014from 1 in 184 Americans to 1 in 76 .\nFor children , the rise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled by mental illness that they qualify for SSI and SSDI has risen 35-fold in the same two decades .\nAntidepressants are currently the third most common drugs prescribed to Americans 12 and older .\nIf there \u2019 s any basis to rumors of Eli Lilly \u2019 s straw-man-engineering , it was unquestionably a brilliant strategy .\nFor twenty years\u2014until the Zyprexa Papers Scandal in 2007 exposed Lilly \u2019 s fraud , spurred on Senator Grassley \u2019 s investigations , resulted in billions paid out in injury suits and took the wind out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety or efficacy of mental health drugs or the integrity of industry , no matter how independent or credentialed , was instantly accused of being part of a cult and , for the purposes of public credibility , effectively censored .\nFrau Koma is clever .\nAbout the device : \u201c Koma \u201c is \u201c amok \u201d spelled backwards ; amok\u2014as in \u201c to run amok.\n\u201d \u201c Amoklaufen \u201d is the German expression for \u201c spree-killer.\n\u201d After a mass shooting at the Johannes Gutenberg Gymnasium in Erfurt , Eastern Germany in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code for school shootings\u2014 \u201c Frau Koma kommt \u201d \u2014 \u201c Frau Koma is coming.\n\u201d The code was activated again on March 13th , 2009 , the day that 17 year old student Tim Kretschmer rampaged through a school in Winnedon , Germany , killing 13 and then himself .\nThe term \u201c amok \u201d isn \u2019 t exactly new .\nAfter the Dutch East India Company began shipping 100 tons of opium a year to Indonesia in the 17th century during the first and lesser-known Opium War to pacify the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Javan \u201c amoak \u201d or \u201c kill \u201d \u2014 was popularized by colonists who began observing random mass stabbings perpetrated by opium-crazed Malayans .\nWithout making reference to opium or its source , Rudyard Kipling first used the term \u201c run amok \u201d in English to describe rampaging Malayans who would senselessly hack through crowds with daggers until they were either subdued and killed or took their own lives according to historical accounts .\nThis type of crime\u2014 non-ideological mass killing , mostly performed outside a combat zone by an individual who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militant group , who is motivated neither by specific sexual nor financial incentives , who most often has no extended history of criminality or serious mental disturbance and who uses no stealth in covering the evidence of their crimes which are frequently committed in public or broad daylight\u2014also isn \u2019 t precisely new , though the explosive prevalence of it in developed countries is .\nAlthough the stated motive just prior to many mass killings has often been a bizarre generalized grudge or a contradictory hash of recently adopted political-sounding views , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with little relevance to their irrational complaints if any are even expressed .\nThough they may function enough to systematically and robotically plan an assault , the modern non-ideological \u201c massacrist \u201d doesn \u2019 t engage in the escape strategies expected of an addictively compulsive killer who wishes to remain free to kill again .\nEven in certain mass killings committed by active duty members of the military , a breach in historical pattern has emerged .\nBecause of consistent media misreporting on the history of the Mai Lai massacre and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem the case .\nBut , according to linguist and political media analyst Noam Chomsky , Mai Lai was not a rogue act by servicemen going against orders as it \u2019 s been portrayed .\nInstead Chomsky refers to Mai Lai as simply a \u201c footnote \u201d of the Post-Tet \u201c Accelerated Pacification \u201d campaign which systematically and by design killed over 10,000 civilians in Vietnam in 1968 .\nWhat happened in Mai Lai was intentional and approved and , in military history , it isn \u2019 t unusual .\nBut when Staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults and children while they slept in their beds and set several on fire in March , 2012 , he was not acting on even inferred orders at that moment but against them .\nThere was no machinery in place to cover up or shift around responsibility for the horrific events as there has been for planned atrocities like Mai Lai or Abu Ghraib .\nHe acted alone , not as part of classic \u201c deindividuated violence \u201d ( Phillip Zimbardo , 1969 ) performed by mobs which are typically very attuned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideological authority according to Canadian forensic psychologist Donald Dutton .\nUnlike serial murderers , Bales made no attempt to cover his tracks .\nAnd the media began investigating reports that Bales may have taken Lariam , the anti-malarial drug which Dan Olmstead and Mark Benjamin investigated in 2002 in association with a spate of domestic murder-suicides among members of the military .\nAs Olmsted noted , the Lariam killers lacked histories of escalating violence typical in lethal domestic assaults .\nLariam and other medications commonly prescribed to military personnel have recently been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented one-a-day suicide rate among service people , a statistic which is all the more disconcerting since prospective recruits must pass screens for mental illness before enlisting .\nObviously there \u2019 s been an enormous lag in undertaking the investigation by war machinery responsible for using its ranks as clinical guinea pigs by widely prescribing powerful medications to patch up battle-fatigued combatants rather than relieving them of duty .\nPeter Breggin , testifying this time before the Veterans Affair Committee in February , 2010 , painted a chilling picture of suicidal and violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by pharmaceutical companies for decades .\nIf some believe the traumas of war alone explain Bales \u2019 rampage and suicides among military personnel , it \u2019 s unclear why military suicide rates are currently so much higher than during Vietnam and 3-fold higher than during the American Civil War .\nMoreover , there \u2019 s very little evidence that psychiatric drugs help to heal traumatic response .\nIn fact , as reported in journalist Robert Whitaker \u2019 s website , Mad in America , a recent study found that the drugs may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trauma : Bruce McEwen and Joseph LeDoux , whose pioneering research in eliminating fear-related memories opened up new avenues for the potential treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder , show in research published in Biological Psychiatry on December 20 , 2012 that chronic treatment with citalopram ( selective serotonin inhibitor Celexa ) or tianeptine ( selective serotonin reuptake enhancer Stablon ) impairs amygdala-dependent learning and consequently the ability to learn new responses to fear-related stimuli and to unlearn conditioned fear responses .\nAnd how would the extreme trauma of war explain the same upsurge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living far from combat zones ?\nLike 19 year old Gutenberg killer Robert Steinhauser , teen shooter Tim Kretschmer of Winnedon had recently taken medication which contained black box warnings for violent behavior and suicide .\nLike Kretschmer , Steinhauser killed himself as police closed in .\nThough Steinhauser \u2019 s post-mortem tox screen showed an absence of drugs or alcohol , just prior to his death he \u2019 d confessed in an interview to dabbling with the painkiller Tilidine and LSD , both of which can have lingering psychiatric effects after withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent behavior in human and animal studies .\nIn fact , researchers found the carcinogenic effects of Tilidine difficult to study because most male lab animals exposed to the drug would die from aggression and mutilation .\nPolice in Germany have found that an abnormal amount of force is often needed to subdue suspects under the influence of the drug due to an almost total lack of pain response .\nPepper spray reportedly has no effect .\nBecause Tilidine is banned in the US , it might seem irrelevant to the rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like SSRI antidepressants and LSD , Tilidine is associated with lack of atonic paralysis in REM sleep : those under the influence may act out their dreams .\nDreams experienced on these drugs are frequently reported to be violent and terrifying\u2014another effect associated with Lariam .\nSuspension of REM sleep atonia has been tied to inexplicably violent acts .\nFollowing the Erfurt and Winnedon shootings , the media response in Germany ranged from calling for stricter gun controls , bans on violent video games , screening students for mental illness to throwback conjectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has always been the response .\nA list of prescription drug-associated

interesting that the law firm which the university hired to shield Fenton and perhaps other mental health practitioners on staff , Wells Anderson and Race , has professional ties to GlaxoSmithKline ,

Aurora tragedy , as in the German school shootings , there are continuing conjectures that Holmes was a hypnotized \u201c Manchurian candidate , \u201d on street drugs or that , like Bell Tower killer Charles Whitman , Holmes might suffer from a specific brain disease .\nThe drug link might not be immediately apparent from the Whitman Bell Tower case in 1966 : Though the amphetamines which Whitman

the then-new beta-blockers which , by 1966 , had become standard treatment for the \u201c horrendous \u201d migraines Whitman suffered due to an undiagnosed brain tumor .\nBeta-blockers can induce

requesting that money from his life insurance plan be donated to a mental health foundation to prevent \u201c further tragedies of this type.\n\u201d Whitman also requested that an autopsy be done after his death to investigate whether anything could explain his actions and worsening migraines .\nAll told , what \u2019 s especially disturbing about the Bell Tower case is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class prescription and illegal drugs , dysfunctional family history and brain tumor to generate an approximation of the rage , dementia and robotic planning involved in modern mass assaults which are frequently linked to only a single newer class prescription medication .\nThis would lend to conjectures that a particularly modern type of prescription drug psychosis could be the common denominator in this type of relatively modern killing .\nAlthough the seal on the Holmes case means the public won \u2019 t know the facts any time soon\u2014or at all as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the moment it

elephant in the room \u201d which the press and public would not discuss , though he also pointed out in an article for Huffington Post that Hasan would not have been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the media have expressed surprise that a man whose profession is about caring would turn to violence .\nAccording to one theory , Dr. Hasan was driven to the breaking point by the stress of counseling returning soldiers and having to listen to their horrific stories .\nTotally false .\nPsychiatrists are no longer trained to listen to or to counsel their patients .\nNor do they care to.I \u2019 ve given seminars to the staff at both hospitals where Hasan was trained , Walter Reed in DC and the national military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The psychiatrists had no interest in anything except medicating their patients\u2026 being an ordinary [ i.e.\n, a psychiatric drug-dispensing ] psychiatrist is deadly depressing .\nPsychiatrists routinely commit spiritual murder by disregarding and suppressing their patients \u2019 feelings and even their cognitive functions , making it impossible for them to conquer their emotional struggles .\nIt \u2019 s no wonder my colleagues have such high suicide and drug addiction rates .\nAt first glance , there are other twists and contradictions within the theory of substance-induced violence , though personal histories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who deliberately choose a mind-altering agent to amplify aggression or those without histories of violence who suddenly commit heinous acts on prescription drugs .\nIt was not always understood , for instance , that while alcoholism can increase violent tendencies , it may not be the cause of violence .\nWhen Carrie Nation led the campaign for the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920 \u2019 s , she and her followers were fueled by then-prevalent medical theories that domestic abusers were driven to commit violence against women due to the \u201c demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissociative \u201c battering \u201d personality traits stem from repeat childhood humiliation and abuse by a same-sex role model and/or witnessing domestic violence against a parent\u2014 experiences which long precede the use of alcohol .\nThis is also demonstrated by high rates of domestic violence in some cultures which traditionally prohibit alcohol consumption .\nBattering statistics don \u2019 t hinge on banning alcohol\u2014they hinge on banning the act itself : domestic violence rates are highest where there \u2019 s the least enforcement against it .\nFurthermore , author , expert and clinical researcher Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who display both pathological and criminal tendencies will reportedly use substances in order to ramp up aggression and to manufacture an alibi for their actions .\nOverlaps between drug-induced and deliberately drug-boosted violence in an era where more\u2014 and more dangerous\u2014prescription drugs are available are admittedly confusing .\nDue to his long-standing ties to neo-Nazi and right-wing anti-Muslim organizations , Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik fits the more traditional profile of ideologically-motivated and militant mass-murderer .\nBut even Breivik reportedly took a cocktail of ephedrine , steroids and caffeine \u201c to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bombed government buildings , killing eight , and opened fire in a Ut\u00f8ya island camp linked with the Norwegian Labor Party , where he killed 69 , mostly teenagers .\nAccording to some reports , Anders took ephedrine and steroids for many years to combat a weight problem and he \u2019 d been \u201c off \u201d since anyone outside his militant circles remembered him .\nWhether or not long term substance abuse could account for long-standing psychopathology , Breivik attested that his use of \u201c ECA Stack \u201d \u2014the combination of ephedrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen deliberately in order to increase aggressiveness in pre-attack journal entries : Noticing that the testo [ erone ] withdrawal is contributing to increased aggressiveness .\nAs I \u2019 m now continuing with 50mg it will most likely pass .\nI wish it would be possible to somehow manipulate this effect to my advantage later on when it is needed .\nBecause the state seems to very efficiently suppress fear .\nI wonder if it is possible to acquire specialized \u201c aggressiveness \u201d pills on the market .\nIt would probably be extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when combined with steroids and ECA stack\u2026 !\nIt would turn you into a superhuman one-man-army for 2 hours !\nThe degree to which any drug fueled killer may have had special access to information on clinical warnings and took the drugs anyway obviously reflects degrees of responsibility .\nIt may not always imply\u2014as it most likely does in Breivik \u2019 s case\u2014 that the drugs were taken either as a facilitator or as an alibi for intent to kill just as it \u2019 s unlikely most drunk drivers got behind the wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nBut drunk drivers are still held responsible .\nIt \u2019 s also clear that anyone forcibly placed on drugs who lacks the capacity to give truly informed consent\u2014 such as minor children , those forced to take medications by court order or for life-threatening medical conditions ( e.g.\n, seizures ) and the elderly suffering from dementia\u2014 are therefore not responsible for the effects , though their prescribers and industry are doubly so .\nFor some onlookers , any explanation for these crimes which casts killers as anything less than inherently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d in a negative sense , whether the search for mitigating factors is framed as a \u201c bleeding heart \u201d social posture or as motivated by an agenda towards pharmaceutical manufacturers or corporate power in general .\nBut this view ignores the fact that the \u201c black and white \u201d analysis of these crimes is politically guided in itself and , in the case that drugs play a role in certain cases of modern violence , this is incredibly dangerous .\nThe degree to which \u201c experts \u201d refuse to educate themselves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription medications alone can drive some individuals , particularly minors , to commit violence who might not have otherwise ensures that the trend continues .\nWhy would anyone want the trend to continue ?\nIf the trend is largely drug-fueled , even within the idea that it \u2019 s being allowed to continue solely for profit and related politicized reasons such as tort deflection and a good-money-after-bad defense of clinical and corporate reputations , a great deal is lost in a simplistic analysis of human motivation which ignores belief and ideology .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , how easily some observers will ascribe a willful motive to take ultimate power over human life to individuals who explode in violence in public , make few attempts to conceal their identity and invariably end up dead or in prison .\nBut , on the other hand , it can be difficult for the same observers to understand that certain authorities might not be exempt from a motive to take power over other human beings in a scenario that results not in death , imprisonment and infamy for those in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science and public health .\nFor example , organized psychiatry faced a conundrum in light of landmark legal cases which exposed conflicting drives : when held responsible for the actions of patients in Tarasoff , members of the American Psychiatric Association protested that psychiatrists are incapable of predicting future actions of patients .\nPsychiatrists , who had long claimed the ability to gauge the future course of patients \u2019 conditions and their future actions , were suddenly scrambling to slough off responsibility when the threat of being held liable for crimes committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profession continues to demand control over patients under their charge .\nAnd so psychiatry argues for the power to force high risk treatments on patients who \u2019 ve neither committed nor threatened violence as Satel and Torrey propose , based simply on a practitioner \u2019 s assessment that the individual is \u201c seriously mentally ill \u201d and therefore a potential danger to the public or themselves .\nHow does psychiatry maintain the precarious posture between disdaining responsibility and pleading that they have no crystal ball when things go wrong while still demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on predictive prowess ?\nThrough fraud .\nIn a response to Torrey \u2019 s Heritage Foundation appearance entitled Heritage Foundation Presents Next Step in Evolution of Police State : Perjury , The Guardian referred to Torrey as a \u201c perjury proponent \u201d in reference to Torrey 's statements in several published works .\nIt would probably be difficult to find any American psychiatrist working with the mentally ill who has not , at a minimum , exaggerated the dangerousness of a mentally ill person \u2019 s behavior to obtain a judicial order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applebaum in defense of this strategy , Confronted with psychotic persons who might well benefit from treatment and might certainly suffer without it , mental health professionals and judges alike were reluctant to comply with the law\u2026in the dominance of the commonsense model , the laws are sometimes simply disregarded .\nFabricating predictive powers in order to force treatment and ignoring the increased risk of violence from those proposed treatments all direct the attention to motives and incentives .\nAn obvious incentive : one-fifth of the American Psychiatric Association \u2019 s funding comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steeped in financial conflicts\u2014 from industry kickbacks for promoting and prescribing , to financial incentives in DSM panel policy , to hiding conflicts by hiring doctors through third parties to conduct industry funded continuing medical education forums .\nBut again , profit isn \u2019 t the only human motivation which science and medicine are subject to along with any other human undertaking .\nAdriana Gamondes is a contributing editor to Age of Autism and a Facebook page administrator .\nShe and her husband commute between Massachusetts and Florida and are the proud parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from psychotropic drugs can often be more dangerous than continuing on a medication .\nIt is important to withdraw extremely slowly from these drugs under the supervision of a qualified speciaa .\nWithdrawal symptoms are sometimes more severe than the original

, but we do our best to balance his needs and ours .\nThat balancing act can happen after we take time to do some brainstorming .\nTake last Wednesday , for example , when I wanted to get just one of

asked the others to stay home with Ronan .\nOriginally , they could .\nAfter making those solid , perfect plans , instead of just one teen going to confession , minds were changed .\nI now had two

cake for Ronan \u2019 s brother ?\nSure .\nBut I had my heart set on the fancy bakery with the beautiful cakes that cost a tiny bit more at my favorite grocery store that \u2019 s down the highway about 30 minutes away not too far from the church that hosts a beautiful adoration during evening confessions .\nIt was the second day in a row that Ronan needed a nap .\nThe day before , he signed

properties .\nPainkillers may have a place in medicine ; but the problem for marketing strategy is they can \u2019 t be mandated and practitioners who overprescribe can face criminal charges .\nSince court-mandated drugging is largely based on efficacy theory\u2014the idea that these drugs essentially \u201c fix \u201d the brain in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since forced drugging in institutions , foster care and prisons and drugging as a condition of receiving social services or Medicaid ( effectively forced ) represent a large chunk of the psychopharmaceutical market\u2014 this explains the need for tobacco science to argue clinical benefits , from fake studies of \u201c brain chemical imbalance correction \u201d to genetic theories of mental illness .\nSince Senator Grassley began his investigations of pharmaceutical marketing and research fraud , regulatory and industry cover-up and academic capitulation , the public has become slightly more aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if information is power , the public remains crucially disempowered .\nSome individuals , for example , may choose to avoid drugs as a personal choice because their evolving awareness of risk reports outweighed the seriousness of their own complaints .\nBut the same individuals might nevertheless believe public safety could be compromised if certain other people weren \u2019 t forced to take medication , particularly since only a few independent investigative journalists like Evelyn Pringle have resisted industry pressure to withhold key facts which might change the assumptions .\nAccording to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up and funded by psychiatric drug makers over the past 25 years have made it nearly impossible to educate the public about the serious adverse effects associated with psychotropic drugs , particularly suicide and violence .\nLike members of many prominent industry front groups which began as consumer non-profits , local NAMI chapter members may be largely ignorant of NAMI \u2019 s history and driving policies .\nNAMI \u2019 s members may claim to be working for internal change , though that change has not been forthcoming in the 33 years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benign intent , NAMI has managed to attach itself and its medication/forced treatment models to criminal , juvenile and family court systems and law enforcement nationwide .\nNAMI is also officially sanctioned and has also been slated by compromised National Institute of Mental Health director Tom Insel as one of only two \u201c consumer partners \u201d of the NIMH , along with another industry front group , Mental Health America ( formerly the National Mental Health Association ) .\nThe NIMH itself has long been identified as an industry-captured regulatory body which maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pharmaceutical companies which share board members with mainstream media corporations and collectively rank next to fast food and the automotive industry for ad spending .\nSenator Grassley \u2019 s investigation of these \u201c charity \u201d organizations which Pringle participated in verified that their budgets are largely supported by money from drug companies \u2013 \u201c results that sadly got very little coverage in the MSM\u2014 leaving the public unsuspecting of the underlying motives of all these so-called \u2018 patient advocacy groups , \u2019 \u201d she warns .\nIn return for the massive funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a great deal to protect psych drugs profits over the years : For instance , their leaders have showed up at every single FDA advisory meeting held to decide whether to add warnings about suicide and violence to the labels of antidepressants and testified against adding the warnings .\nAnd every year , the groups recruit family members and friends of suicide victims in communities all over the US to unwittingly participate in drug marketing schemes disguised as \u2018 suicide prevention \u2019 walks and programs without ever mentioning that the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medications the schemes are aimed at selling that cause people to become suicidal .\nYear after year they recruit using the same old phony lines .\nFamily members and friends are told to be on the look-out for loved ones who might be depressed \u2013 people are committing suicide because not enough are getting treatment - which translates into drugs , drugs and more drugs only .\nThe MSM actually helps the groups promote these blatant drug peddling schemes with public service announcements\u2026Obviously because their budgets are also so overly dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one \u201c gain \u201d to be had in pushing the drug paradigm , it \u2019 s a big one .\nBut Pringle can easily attest how drugs have become our culture and how the public and scientific authorities alike are turned into psychiatric \u201c informants \u201d through disinformation and the cultural currency of fear , faith in progress and the universal need to believe that the devil wears horns .\nAnd the culture-capture doesn \u2019 t stop at the 6 o \u2019 clock news .\nCannes nominated film We Need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar story of an empathy-impaired-from-birth mass murdering teen with a curious resemblance to the young Hitler clones in Boys from Brazil .\nIt \u2019 s The Omen for pop-psych millenarians and too lousy a movie to be worth dissecting in many ways , but the message and timing are telling and the film could serve as a \u201c lurid parable \u201d as a Guardian reviewer wrote , though not in the way the reviewer probably intended it .\nAt the end of the We Need to Talk About Kevin , the fictional mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played his cards in court : \u201c You managed it all so well .\nTried as a minor , out of your head on Prozac\u2026You \u2019 ll be out of there in a couple of years.\n\u201d On the meaning of that particular line , author Lionel Shriver is very clear : Of course , Kevin is indeed sent to a psychiatrist as an adolescent ( which many of these why-didn \u2019 t-the-parents-seek-professional-help readers fail to notice ) .\nBut he \u2019 s a wiley , manipulative little fellow , isn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Prozac to plan his post-Thursday judicial defence\u2014since Prozac has been identified as having a psychotic effect on a small minority of patients .\nWithout quite denying that drugs might cause a few rare psychotic outbursts , the author attempts to inoculate viewers against increasing suspicions that prescription drugs might partly or even greatly explain many modern mass murders .\nEven if it \u2019 s admitted that Prozac didn \u2019 t work to curb a character \u2019 s violent impulses , the film implicitly sells force and a horned devil\u2014that those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed .\nAs another scathing review summed it up , Probably viewed by all involved as an important contribution to the nature/ nurture debate and a stark commentary on the taxonomy of evil , the only thing this movie succeeds in doing is dumbing down a complex issue to the point where it feels like an episode of Sesame Street brought to you by the word \u2018 dysfunction \u2019 , the number \u2018 666 \u2019 and the colour \u2018 red \u2019 \u2026The problem with Kevin in that he \u2019 s such an unambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any kind of empathy \u2013 and it doesn \u2019 t take a degree in psychiatry to know from about ten minutes in that he needs to be taken as far away from civilisation as possible \u2013 maybe to Swindon \u2013 and put in a padded cell on a diet of bread , water and really , really strong anti-psychotics .\nShriver mentions in the Bookgroup interview that there are more dimensions in the overlap between \u201c nature and nurture \u201d than in one or the other in terms of depicting psychopathology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp that by \u201c genetic , \u201d mainstream geneticists aren \u2019 t indicating \u201c 100 % genetic \u201d but \u201c largely genetic \u201d or \u201c mostly genetic \u201d \u2014just as Shriver implies of her fictional assassin .\nIn an obviously coordinated press junket for the film , UK autism researcher and pharmaceutical defender Simon Baron-Cohen similarly hems and haws on the \u201c nature/nurture \u201d quandary only to ultimately land , like Kevin \u2019 s author , on the \u201c largely genetic \u201d interpretation in a Daily Mail review : At zero degrees of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kevin .\nFrom everything we are shown in this gripping film , psychopaths are born callous .\nAnd yet , the film ( like the science ) does not want us to settle too comfortably into the idea that the cause of psychopathic low empathy is purely genetic .\nIt hints , disturbingly , at the role of psychological conflict in Kevin \u2019 s mother , about whether she is trying to love him without truly loving him .\nThe science confirms that environmental and emotional factors do also play a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but teasing apart cause and effect in such hard-to-parent children is a tall order .\nIn people who end up as psychopaths , brain regions connected with empathy are under-active .\nThe science also tells us that empathy is a complex skill , with several components .\nTwo major ones are \u201c cognitive \u201d empathy ( the capacity to recognise what someone else thinks or feels ) and \u201c affective \u201d empathy ( the capacity to feel an appropriate emotion in response to someone else \u2019 s thoughts and feelings ) .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affective empathy ( they just don \u2019 t care about someone else \u2019 s feelings ) but have excellent cognitive empathy ( able to worm their way into someone else \u2019 s mind by using their ability to figure out what someone else might think , want or feel ; able to manipulate others through deception ) .\nThe film doesn \u2019 t touch more established \u201c environmental \u201d patterns of the deliberate and organized use of substances to fuel violence , such as Hitler ordering the Luftwaffe to consume huge amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abducted boy soldiers in Sierra Leon , or Breivik \u2019 s deliberate doping in service of a violent political movement .\nThis is because the film seeks to generalize on a disconnected relatively recent form of school shootings : non-ideological mass murder performed mostly by lone perpetrators with no association to violent militant organizations , who most often have no criminal background , make no attempt to escape and harbor no specifically personal gripes against targets .\nInstead the film attempts to offer a stand-in for group affiliation , organized ideology and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture is fomenting the deadly nihilism of the demon seeds lurking among us .\nAt one point Kevin mumbles out a monologue peppered with teen-ironic emotional quotation marks : You wake up and watch TV .\nYou get in your car and listen to the radio .\nYou go to your job or your little school .\nBut you \u2019 re not going to hear about that on the six o \u2019 clock new .\nWhy ?\nBecause nothing is really happening\u2026 I mean it \u2019 s got so bad that half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 re watching TV .\nAnd what are all these people watching ?\nHuh ?\nPeople like me .\nAnd what are all you doing right now but watching me ?\nYou don \u2019 t think they would have changed the channel by now if all I did was get an A in geometry ?\nBut the character \u2019 s goth nihilism is no more or less meaningless or untouched by history and context than Baron-Cohen \u2019 s or the filmmakers \u2019 .\nThe film \u2019 s villain isn \u2019 t alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworthy .\nFirst , one of many things making the news media so hollow and making the public so lost on the issues\u2014and at risk\u2014in the age of chemical psychosis is , as Evelyn Pringle demonstrates , the lack of reporting on prescription drug-induced violence and suicide .\nEven when the major media presents a supposedly `` balanced view '' of the hunt for identifying factors among populations `` at risk '' for violence , particularly in terms of predicting random mass killings , prescription drugs receive no scrutiny .\nSo if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , he would have had to perform pointed searches from the previously mentioned scarce alternative media sources to generate a Prozac defense .\nIn doing this , he would have figured out that such a strategy would never be allowed to succeed in what would be , in real life , a high profile mass murder case .\nOnly in a few obscure cases has the prescription defense managed to even reduce charges .\nBut why haven \u2019 t students mass murdered their classmates for as long as there have been schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d ?\nWhy didn \u2019 t these specific crimes occur\u2014moreover undergo a spike in rate\u2014 during eras when Dickensian child-rearing , legal domestic violence and taking children to public executions were commonplace if these zero-empathy-gene carriers only need a subtle environmental jump-start ?\nUsing Wikipedia \u2019 s list of American school shootings as a guide but weeding out \u201c classic \u201d crimes ( the types of crimes that have always existed ) , a pattern emerges which is illustrated in a simple table below .\nThe table includes only mass assaults by students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on two or more students , or attacks on one or more student if coupled with an assault on staff ) , or by adults not associated with a school assaulting students and staff with no comprehensible motive , such as targeted revenge against a specific individual for a perceived wrong , sexual , financial or ideological/militant motives .\nIf the attacker killed themselves and other bystanders or family member in the course of the spree , these are included .\nTo explain why it was used for this purpose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c active \u201d list ( with new additions made and citations added ) and has the benefit of being slanted in the reverse direction of the argument being made here : Wikipedia , known to be monitored and edited by various industries which closely control certain entries , does not focus on the prescription drug use of mass school shooters or may not mention it at all , even when this information was confirmed after a particular crime .\nThe school shootings excluded are those such as targeted revenge attacks by adults on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students on staff or students ; \u201c duels \u201d ; single suicides on school grounds ; domestic or sexually motivated murders of female students and staff ( the most frequent type of school shooting until 1966 ) ; family members seeking revenge for staff physical punishments on students ( also a seemingly common cause of school shootings prior to 1966 ) ; deaths occurring in the course of staff physical abuse of students ; gang or mob-related violence and related ideologically motivated militant terrorist attacks on schools , including Wiki 's bizarre inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans in 1764 without mention of settlers ' terrorist attacks on Indian children ( presumably because Native Americans did not refer to the education process as `` school '' ) .\nWhat remains in the estimate are crimes in the \u201c inexplicable \u201d category of mass school attacks which the film extrapolates on .\nIn 1966 , Charles Whitman , the amphetamine-addicted Bell Tower shooter who suffered from an undiagnosed brain tumor and migraines\u2014 for which he may have been prescribed other drugs\u2014 set the precedent for a student committing a lethal mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to available information , prior to 1966 , there was a single lethal mass assault on students and staff by an adult staff member of a school in the US and only one non-lethal attack by an adult with no relationship to a school .\nBefore 1966 , there were no recorded mass assaults by a student on other students and staff .\n1960-1970 : 3 mass assaults by students or recent former students on students and staff ; 1 assault on students and staff by adult with no relationship to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Whitman ) .\n1970- 1980 : 3 mass assaults by students or recent former students on students and staff ; 2 assaults on students and staff by adults with no relationship to the schools .\n15 dead 1980-1990 : 5 mass assaults by students or recent former students on students and staff .\n5 dead 1990-2000 : 15 mass assaults by students or recent former students on students and staff .\n42 dead .\n2000- 2010 : 5 mass shootings by students or recent former students on other students and staff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adults with no relationship to the schools .\n72 dead .\n2010- 2013 : 5 mass shootings by students or recent former students on students and staff .\n41 dead .\nWhile some insist that there \u2019 s been \u201c increased recognition \u201d of mental illness , it would be strange to argue for \u201c increased recognition \u201d of mass civilian murder or increased recognition of the determination to commit it : The rarity of the earliest mass school shootings , particularly those perpetrated by children on other children , meant they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hardly anyone is familiar with One Goh \u2019 s lethal mass attack in 2012 .\nMed-madness may not explain every crime , though the increase in non-ideological , \u201c inexplicable \u201d mass killing incidents in schools would appear to mesh with the availability of certain drugs more closely than it does population increase or other societal advents , such as the availability of powerful assault weapons .\nThe sheer death tolls from separate attacks are clearly related to the types of weapons used ; but Charles Whitman managed to slay 16 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in farming and mining communities once had easy , undocumented access to explosives and there \u2019 s never been a shortage of matches ; but if these types of attacks follow the patterns seen in other developed countries and had been included in the estimate , the increase might appear even more staggering .\nAlthough Prozac wasn \u2019 t FDA approved for use in children until 2003 , it was increasingly prescribed to school-aged children from the time it was first marketed in the late 1980 \u2019 s , followed by a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and second generation or \u201c atypical \u201d antipsychotics .\nPrior to that , stimulants and first generation antipsychotics had been marketed for use in children since the 1950 \u2019 s , followed by earlier generation antidepressants , Valium and other \u201c anxiolytics \u201d and sedatives .\nTo repeat , the number of children so disabled by mental illness that they qualify for SSI and SSDI has risen 35-fold in the past two decades along with the increase in prescription drug use .\nLike Baron-Cohen , the creative team behind We Need to Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions on the genetic roots of violence behind a feigned spirit of \u201c exploration \u201d as they waffle around the total lack of science supporting the existence of a gene or \u201c set of genes \u201d for violent criminality .\nIt \u2019 s a leap of faith that they seem sure science will eventually exonerate , but they hedge the bet for credibility .\nAmong the \u201c environmental accents \u201d dribbled through the plot , the film offers enigmas for popular generalization : If someone harbors shallow political criticisms of shallow media culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of satisfaction that a glimpse of Kevin playing a video game with his dad advances their pet theory that modern mass killings are caused by violent gaming and the commercialized void .\nIf they think junk food explains it , they can watch pre-school Kevin angrily stuffing his mouth with neon orange cheese puffs in one brief scene .\nViewers who prefer the view that cold , selfish mothers cause modern school shootings can find fodder watching Kevin \u2019 s mother struggle not to hate or physically assault her malicious offspring .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ already leaned to the idea of the born psychopath .\nBut if a viewer believes that relatively new prescription drugs could play a role in the modern advent of mass school killings , they \u2019 ll walk away with suspicions about the film \u2019 s financial backing .\nBut the film didn \u2019 t go blockbuster and the casting and unhappy hipster style suggest it was never intended as anything other than an art house sleeper aimed at an influential , progressive boutique audience who are predisposed , like Baron-Cohen , to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs it happens , Kevin was co-produced by Steven Soderbergh who was arguably at the top of his game when he made a radical shift from championing consumer advocates ( Erin Brockovich ) to attacking them in two films , Contagion and Kevin , which both play like extended public service announcements for the pharmaceutical industry and public health .\nThose who point out that Che , Soderbergh 's biopic on Marxist revolutionary Ernesto `` Che '' Guevara , hardly qualified as pro-corporate would be missing the point .\nThough Guevara\u2014who happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been part of an inevitable counter-force attempting to release Latin America from the clutches of North American corporate slave labor , the Marxist and Cuban template for public health share the same roots as that of the US\u2014namely the French revolutionary model generated by radical Jacobin anti-monarchists which sought to replace the divine right of kings with the secular collective divinity of the state .\nNot all countries ' social health structures verge on utopian extremes ; but as reform psychiatrist Thomas Szasz writes in Coercion as Cure , the `` sacralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are `` converted from servants of their patients to agents of public health . ''\nEven Contagion , which had a more blockbustery early run than Kevin , made only a fifth of the box office for Soderbergh \u2019 s Ocean \u2019 s Thirteen .\nThe project choices probably weren \u2019 t about the money .\nInstead Soderbergh \u2019 s recent spree appears to be some kind of ideological fork strategy to correct growing public rebellion against commercial science , public suspicion over regulatory conflicts and , considering the common thread running between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misguided \u201d public conceptions of autism .\nSoderbergh claims to be fascinated with the process of making ideas \u201c contagious \u201d promoted by corporate propaganda guru and The Tipping Point author Malcolm Gladwell .\nWhat I need to find out , from someone like Malcolm Gladwell , is how do people change their minds ?\nWhat is the process by which a person changes their mind about a deeply held belief ?\nWhat \u2019 s the thing that clicks over for them ?\nI have no idea .\nClearly people do change their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work ?\nIs it gradual , sudden ?\nIs it through a peer ?\nWhat \u2019 s the source of the information ?\nGladwell is famed for using Bernaisian \u201c obfuscation , distraction , suggestion \u201d and the \u201c the subtle introduction of doubt \u201d to shill in defense of financial institutions , Penn State \u2019 s inaction in the Sandusky scandal , Big Tobacco and Big Pharma , including apologias for psychopharmaceuticals and the purported genetic roots of mental disorders : What further confounds the culture-of-Ritalin school is that A.D.H.D .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ component .\nAs a result of numerous studies of twins conducted around the world over the past decade , scientists now estimate that A.D.H.D .\nis about seventy per cent heritable .\nThis puts it up there with the most genetically influenced of traits -- traits such as blood pressure , height , and weight .\nMeanwhile , the remaining thirty per cent -- the environmental contribution to the disorder -- seems to fall under what behavioral geneticists call `` non-shared environment , '' meaning that it is likely to be attributable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injury rather than factors that siblings share , such as parenting styles or socioeconomic class .\nThat 's why the way researchers describe A.D.H.D .\nhas changed over the past decade .\nThere is now less discussion of the role of bad parents , television , and diet and a lot more discussion of neurology and the role of specific genes .\nIn Contagion , Soderbergh \u2019 s possible homage to Gladwell \u2019 s conception of \u201c epidemic \u201d ideas and the \u201c Mavens \u201d and \u201c Connectors \u201d who push them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers are defended as martyred heroes .\nIn keeping with Bernay \u2019 s and Gladwell \u2019 s methods of doubt-implantation and herd-like view of \u201c the masses , \u201d the public are depicted as hysterical fad-magnets who die in droves because they have forsaken true science to follow a criminal charlatan who questions the safety of vaccines and who suggests that vaccines cause autism .\nIn The Tipping Point , Gladwell writes , \u201c There is a simple way to package information that , under the right circumstances , can make it irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it.\n\u201d Jude Law , the actor playing criminal \u201c naturopath \u201d Krumweide ( German for \u201c krummen \u201d = crooked ; \u201c weide \u201d = field ) claimed the character was based on Lancet Paper author Andrew Wakefield .\nWakefield , who lost his license to practice medicine in politicized attacks on the study \u2019 s findings that novel bowel disorders in autistic children might have an association with the measles , mumps , rubella vaccine , was remotely exonerated when colleague John Walker Smith won a reversal of the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court at about the time the film was released .\nIn Contagion , Soderbergh didn \u2019 t need to look very far to find irresistible packaging for his \u201c good and evil \u201d idea-Mavens : in order to make the character instantly detestable , Law \u2019 s bandy-legged , angry-Cockney characterization resembled , sort of confusingly , not so much Wakefield as Brian Deer , the reportedly pharma-funded Murdoch freelancer who filed the initial viral complaint against Wakefield and is named in an appealed libel claim .\nIn his pop-think bestseller Blink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception of autistic \u201c mind-blindness \u201d and , in roundabout terms , Baron-Cohen and Yale autism researcher Ami Klin \u2019 s views of autistic empathy deficits .\nWith the backing of Kevin , Soderbergh seems to finish his Gladwellian tactical assault by attempting to counter the view that pharmaceutical drugs have some association with modern mass murder .\nBy deduction , what remains is the idea that autism may relate to genetic psychopathology .\nAt the start of the film , which follows Kevin \u2019 s mother and father from courtship to parenthood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are every inch the experience of many autism parents , except \u201c Kevin \u201d is clearly \u201c born with it.\n\u201d Whatever \u201c it \u201d is , it looks a lot like autism .\nThe fictional mother , played by Tilda Swinton , even asks a pediatrician\u2014 whose exam room is covered in huge , grotesque posters of clowns\u2014 if toddler-Kevin is autistic but is reassured that Kevin \u2019 s lack of \u201c rocking behavior \u201d rules out the condition .\nSince rocking behavior isn \u2019 t a required criterion in the Diagnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken as a comment on clinical cluelessness .\nThe clowns aren \u2019 t subtle and the filmmakers are clearly presenting infantile autism as a kind of genetic roulette spin that could somehow land on \u201c violent psychopath.\n\u201d Though most autism families witness their healthy infants regressing into illness and disability , the regression , illness and physical pain are excised , reinforcing the \u201c mystery \u201d of the born killer and its supposed cold-blooded connection to \u201c genetic autism.\n\u201d The dead giveaway that Kevin \u2019 s creators scoured the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s characterization is a moment when preschool Kevin gets the flu and , for a fleeting time during his fever , normalizes into an affectionate and responsive child .\nStill , defining autism and sanctifying drugs may not be the actual endgame of Soderbergh \u2019 s project choices .\nThey \u2019 re \u201c lurid parables \u201d for something larger .\nPartly as a consequences of parsed and filtered \u201c murdertainment \u201d depictions of mass murder and censored data on adverse drug effects , the rate of consumers who take psychotropic medications without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one in ten adults and children in the US take one or more psychiatric drugs including antidepressants .\n5-20 % of these individuals will experience drug-induced psychosis and mania according to the American Psychiatric Association , accounting for 8.1 % of all psychiatric hospital admissions .\nRobert Whitaker factors that if 8 % of the 10.741 million \u201c patient care episodes \u201d reported by the federal government in 2000 were indeed prescription drug-induced mania and psychosis , this could mean up to 860,000 Americans have this type of reaction .\nThat \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given moment , go postal .\nIt \u2019 s interesting that the term \u201c going postal , \u201d according to Dr. Ann Blake Tracy , entered the vernacular because of a number of postal workers who experienced violent mania and killed while taking antidepressants .\nIf fear sells , there \u2019 s a great deal of selling potential in every disaster that arises from these statistics as long as the association to prescription drugs is obscured .\nBut what exactly is being sold ?\nThe purported genetic origins of various forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence from affected populations are essential to psychopharmaceutical marketing and the marketing of mental illness .\nIn their paper , Schizophrenia : Medical Students are Taught it \u2019 s All in the Genes but Are They Hearing the Whole Story ?\n, neuroscientists Jonathan Leo and Jay Joseph write , The idea that schizophrenia is due at least in part to a genetic predisposition is seen as an accepted fact in modern day psychiatry .\nThe acceptance of this theory is not only important for how psychiatrists approach the research and treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire field of psychiatry\u2026The genetic theory of schizophrenia is frequently cited as evidence in favor of genetic predisposition to other conditions ; the thinking being that if schizophrenia is genetic , then depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , attention deficit disorder and a host of other DSM IV categories must also have their roots in problematic genes .\n( By the expression \u201c genetic theory of schizophrenia , \u201d we mean the view that although environmental factors might be important , genetic factors are equally if not more important ) .\nScientists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of genes in certain behaviors , but a specific gene has never been found for those disorders which have no known neurochemical or neuropathological markers .\nin the case of schizophrenia , several scientists have reported finding a \u201c schizophrenia gene \u201d only to eventually retract their findings ( e.g.\n, Marshall , 1994 ; Sherrington et al.\n, 1988 ) .\nBefore autism , schizophrenia was central in attempting to demonstrate the genetic root of mental illness as well as for generating public approval for forced institutionalization and treatment due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Loren Mosher , while directing schizophrenia studies for the National Institute of Mental Health , declared that schizophrenia was clearly \u201c environmental \u201d after the agency completed extensive analyses ( Breggin , The War Against Children of Color , 1998 ; p. 54 ) .\nMosher made this statement to counter the agency \u2019 s press releases at the time , which inexplicably reported the reverse of the NIMH \u2019 s actual findings .\nLeo \u2019 s and Joseph \u2019 s review , like many other studies , found that the famed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the genetic basis for the condition not only didn \u2019 t provide support for the gene theory but undercut it .\nJay Joseph also authored The Missing Gene : Psychiatry , Heredity and the Fruitless Search for Genes which questions the \u201c twin method \u201d standard for emphasizing genetic cause of conditions over environmental .\nAs with autism , independent research is discovering immune and toxic factors which may influence the development of schizophrenia .\nAs far as whether drug treatment actually improves conditions for schizophrenia or makes the public or patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to historical documents and institutional statistics , those with schizophrenia weren \u2019 t generally more violent than typical members of the public prior to the invention of mental health drugs .\nWhitaker further argues that mental illness , particularly schizophrenia and other conditions involving delusional or erratic states have been used to back fear-based marketing strategies to peddle drugs , a scheme which is self-fulfilling because violent personality changes and suicidality have been increasingly associated with the atypical and traditional antipsychotics used to treat the disorder .\nWhat \u2019 s more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Health Organization schizophrenia studies from the 1970s which concluded that those not exposed to prescription drugs typically had a roughly two to three fold increased rate of recovery over those chronically exposed to psychiatric medications .\nBut Frau Koma isn \u2019 t interested in the small print .\nNeither is Paul Steinberg of The New York Times , who has frequently weighed in on the supposedly genetic origins of autism and recently called for greater `` risk management '' of mental disability ( forced institutionalization and forced medication ) in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictory op-ed entitled Our Failed Approach to Schizophrenia in which he poses schizophrenics as both less violent and more violent than the general population : ... we have too much concern about privacy , labeling and stereotyping , about the civil liberties of people who have horrifically distorted thinking .\nIn our concern for the rights of people with mental illness , we have come to neglect the rights of ordinary Americans to be safe from the fear of being shot \u2014 at home and at schools , in movie theaters , houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of people with schizophrenia , treated or untreated , are not violent , though they are more likely than others to commit violent crimes .\nWhen treated with medication after a rampage , many perpetrators who have shown signs of schizophrenia \u2014 including John Lennon \u2019 s killer and Ronald Reagan \u2019 s would-be assassin \u2014 have recognized the heinousness of their actions and expressed deep remorse .\nThe small print again : John Hinkley Jr. had taken antidepressants and tranquilizers prior to his attempted assassination ; Mark David Chapman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LSD before killing John Lennon .\nSteinberg complains that the Goldwater Rule prohibiting psychiatric professionals like himself from making unauthorized assessments have a `` chilling effect '' on discussions of violent crime .\nAfter mass murders , our airwaves are filled with unfounded speculations about video games , our culture of hedonism and our loss of religious faith , while psychiatrists , the ones who know the most about severe mental illness , are largely marginalized .\nBut psychiatric views have n't been marginalized in regard to making the latest staple conjecture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism .\nVarious theories attempting to meld criminality and autism have appeared since Hans Asperger subtitled his discovery \u201c autistic psychopathology.\n\u201d In essence , Asperger meant extreme disconnectedness but his choice of terminology has set off speculative scrambles in every new generation of scientists bent on nailing down , once and for all , the ever-elusive \u201c crime gene.\n\u201d In response to ongoing semantic confusion , a team of Austrian researchers tracked the life histories of all 177 of Asperger \u2019 s original patients , searching for any statistical increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From No increase in criminal convictions in Hans Asperger 's original cohort : Abstract : Hans Asperger originally used the term `` autistic psychopathy '' to describe his patients on the autism spectrum , leading to a possible confusion with psychopathic disorder and delinquent behaviour .\nWe conducted a penal register search for 177 former patients of Asperger 's clinic with a childhood diagnosis of `` autistic psychopathy '' or features of the disorder in Austria .\nThe mean percentage of registered convictions was similar to that in the general male population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A qualitative assessment of offence types in Asperger 's former patients suggests that the nature of offences does not differ from that in the general population .\nIn this original cohort of Asperger 's patients , convictions were no more common than in the general male population .\nBut regardless , autism continues to be drawn into the debate on modern crimes , from financial villainy to murder .\nMost recently , autism has been linked to the horrific shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown , Massachusetts on December 14th which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them children under the age of 7 .\nSean Hannity of Fox News convened with Drs .\nMarc Siegel and Keith Ablow on lack of empathy , autism and violent crime .\nNone appeared to be \u201c chilled \u201d by Goldwater or concerns about labeling and stereotyping : Sean Hannity : Now we had heard reports\u2014personality disorder .\nI had heard the term \u201c autism \u201d today , Asperger \u2019 s syndrome\u2026 Obviously this kid , at this age , shooting his mother , going in to shoot with abandon all these kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would any of those conditions tell you that could happen ?\nSiegel : One thing \u2019 s for sure , Sean , he \u2019 s out of touch with reality at the time this occurs .\nIf he had something called Asperger \u2019 s , he may have had ongoing meltdowns which are associated with violent behavior .\nThat \u2019 s possible .\nIt \u2019 s possible he was on medication , that the medication wasn \u2019 t working , that he didn \u2019 t have empathy , that he wasn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had social problems..But that still doesn \u2019 t explain everything .\nIt \u2019 s also possible given he \u2019 s the age of 20 that he became psychotic , that he lost touch with reality completely and that he had some kind of delusional system going on that led to this heinous crime .\nHannity : Is it always a medical condition , I mean\u2026 I \u2019 m asking this as a question\u2026If someone is disconnected from reality , no sympathy , no empathy , no conscience , no consciousness , no soul\u2026There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone can kill innocent children like this , it seems to me that that is human evil .\nSiegel : You know Sean , I don \u2019 t know what Dr. Ablow \u2019 s opinion is on this and we \u2019 re going to hear it in a second , but I personally don \u2019 t let people off the hook and say \u2018 this is a mental health condition , they \u2019 re not evil.\n\u2019 I think the two can coexist.I think there is an issue of evil here as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think .\nI think the final common denominator here is lack of empathy .\nYou can \u2019 t walk up to one child after another , kill that child and see each child fall to the ground and slump over in his or her seat while maintaining any empathy .\nSo why can you lose human empathy ?\nYou could be delusional , schizophrenic perhaps , and be working on a delusional system .\nI don \u2019 t know that to be the case here , but you could be where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I save the whole world.\n\u201d That \u2019 s one level of things .\nSecondly , sure , personality disorders can do this , and there are other conditions that can do this , like drug abuse combined with either a mood disorder or personality disorder or all three .\nBut listen , is it a mental illness ?\nOf course it is , because that lack of mental illness doesn \u2019 t come from nowhere .\nAnd in twenty years , Sean , I \u2019 ve never found anybody who does anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through hell him or herself in a way that creates mental illness .\nNot genetics , it \u2019 s partly life .\nThough limited information on the shooter has been made available and little of it is substantiated , according to the Washington Post , the Newtown perpetrator who killed himself after the attack has been identified as 20 year old Adam Lanza , a socially awkward A student with possible Asperger \u2019 s syndrome who had once attended Sandy Hook .\nOther news releases state that Lanza had become depressed after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atypical antipsychotic Fanapt .\nFanapt is FDA-approved for the treatment of schizophrenia .\nMedical side effects of the drug include tardive dyskinesia , male breast development , cardiometabolic damage and Parkinsonism .\nPsychiatric side effects of Fanapt include akathisia , aggression , mania , delusion , hostility , suicide .\nThe report that Lanza took Fanapt originally appeared in the The New York Daily News which then excised mention of the drug when it was disclosed that the source of the information may not have been Lanza \u2019 s uncle but an imposter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are further reports that Adam Lanza took medication , probably since the age of ten at least and that Lanza \u2019 s mother was in the process of filing for conservatorship of her son in order have him committed .\nIf the court trend of sealing medical records in high profile mass shootings continues , as with Columbine , Virginia Tech and Aurora , the truth may never be confirmed and the hot potato for `` cause '' lands on other targets .\nThe only excessive concern expressed for privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only speculations being chilled are over what prescription drugs they may have taken .\nFollowing the Newtown massacre , several seemingly legitimate sources within the killer \u2019 s family told the media that Lanza had been diagnosed with Asperger \u2019 s , though newscasters don \u2019 t always hold out for confirmation before guessing at a possible link between violence and autism spectrum disorders .\nAfter a series of these premature proclamations , some made within hours of several initial mass assault reports , it \u2019 s clear the theoretical association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wait all along .\nWith the Connecticut tragedy , the pundits might have come up aces at last .\nBut in the wake of the Aurora theater shooting , Joe Scarborough of Fox , an autism father himself , jumped the gun when he stated that James Holmes \u2019 behavior smacked of autism .\nJoe Scarborough speculated Monday that James Holmes , the alleged shooter in Aurora , Colorado , might have been \u201c on the autism scale.\n\u201d Holmes was behind the mass shooting at a midnight showing of \u201c Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , killing twelve of them .\nOn Monday , Scarborough weighed in on the tragic event and said that it was a \u201c mental health issue.\n\u201d The MSNBC host said he \u201c did not want to generalize , \u201d but that he knew who was responsible as soon as he heard about the shooting .\n\u201c I knew it was a young , white male , probably from an affluent neighborhood , disconnected from society , it happens time and time again , \u201d he remarked.\n\u201c Most of it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these people that are somewhere , I believe , probably on the autism scale , \u201d said Scarborough , whose own son has Asperger \u2019 s syndrome .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know if that \u2019 s the case here , but it happens more often than not .\nPeople that can walk around in society , they can function on college campuses , they can even excel on college campuses , but are socially disconnected .\nNorwegian mass shooter Anders Behring Breivik , who again quite clearly fit a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also been suppositionally diagnosed with Asperger \u2019 s by an expert who had never interviewed nor treated Breivik .\nUlrik Fredrik Malt , a psychiatry professor at the University of Oslo , said the 33-year-old Breivik was suffering from Asperger \u2019 s syndrome , Tourette \u2019 s syndrome and narcissistic personality disorder , but was likely not psychotic .\nThe question of Breivik \u2019 s sanity is key to his ongoing trial .\nThough judges are certain to find him guilty , they must decide if he was criminally sane or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets mental treatment in a secure psychiatric facility .\nAsperger \u2019 s is a developmental disorder on the autistic spectrum that often is characterized by a lack of empathy .\nTourette \u2019 s is a neurological disorder marked by tics and verbal outbursts\u2026 Malt said Tourette \u2019 s could explain why Breivik has frequently smiled inappropriately throughout the trial .\nMalt \u2019 s opinion is based on his observations of Breivik during his trial , which started on April 16th , but he has not interviewed the defendant .\nAlthough Malt \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines of what Breivik is trying to prove in court , the defendant lashed out against the diagnosis .\n\u201c I want to congratulate Malt for a very good demolition of my personality , \u201d he said .\nOnce a campaign manager for Nelson Rockefeller \u2019 s presidential run , serial killer Ted Bundy\u2014by all accounts an infamous showman , master manipulator and adept liar\u2014 lured victims through personal charm or by playing on sympathies and attracted serial killer groupies during his trials .\nAccording to biographers , he was raised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d who exposed Bundy to sadistic pornography as a child .\nBundy has been speculatively labeled as \u201c manic-depressive , \u201d \u201c sadistic sociopath \u201d or , due to his infamous charisma , a psychopath .\nA Tampa , Florida news station is currently in possession of the single witness recreation drawing of Bundy \u2019 s execution by electric chair : he was smiling before the hood was pulled over his head .\nBefore he died , Bundy smirked and smiled inappropriately throughout court proceedings , can be seen smiling in photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murders .\nSo much for smiling inappropriately as a diagnostic criterion\u2014 Bundy was never diagnosed with autism or Tourette \u2019 s while he lived , though reports of Bundy \u2019 s timidity in junior high have brought even Bundy in line for the current trend in armchair \u201c autism screening.\n\u201d In the wake of buckshot , post-crime diagnostics , the autism community , like any group misguidedly framed for disaster , has been put on the defense while trying to avoid the ugly pitfall of drawing attention from the immediate victims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including a six year-old boy with autism .\nIn the midst of the Dec. 14 shooting in Connecticut , the shooter \u2019 s brother , Ryan Lanza , has been reported saying that his brother suffered from mental illness and was autistic .\nUnfortunately , those in the mental health communities and autism communities do not get the chance to mourn America \u2019 s loss of all these children but instead are doing what they can to advocate for autism and other mental health concerns before all of us with autistic children or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all labeled as potential murderers .\nPerhaps more unfortunately , the label has a particular tendency to stick to certain targets within the gap of information surrounding modern mass murders and the labels may distract from uncovering actual cause and stopping future crimes .\nMany mainstream advocacy organizations , possibly in order to avoid being labeled as Luddites or to avoid losing corporate sponsorship , steer clear of speculating on the pharmaceutical association .\nThis is true of some groups even when growing evidence of the link between prescription medications and violence could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion between autism and violent criminality to slow the adoption of damaging institutional policies against the disabled\u2014or vigilantism .\nThe blinkered approach neither mourns the direct victims of the crimes nor does it prevent smear attacks which threaten to add the disabled population to the roster of victims in the aftermath .\nBut to address any of it , advocates would have to first acknowledge why the confusion persists .\nSimilar to the environmental injuries strongly associated with the exploding rate of autism\u2014whether the injuries are fast-tracked by vaccine damage , exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury and other vaccine components , or due to an increasingly toxic environment\u2014 the adverse effects of certain prescription drugs appear to be the great equalizers : no matter how unique an individual started out , some will end up , post adverse event or regression , displaying very similar external behaviors .\nFor autism , there are recognizable patterns of regression into stereotypies and injured social and communication capacities across the spectrum which vary mostly by degree of intensity .\nIn the case of drug induced psychosis , many reportedly display almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert accounts have documented a senseless Stepford-wife aspect to drug transformations that seem to involve a shedding of imagination and individuality and sudden convoluted attraction to stock representations of aggression .\nThe sudden , extreme fixation on stock symbols is nearly a given among non-ideological modern killers in the Western Hemisphere : formerly \u201c nice \u201d or \u201c average \u201d or merely \u201c troubled \u201d or \u201c bullied \u201d kids\u2014not to mention children with ethnic identities that might have , at one time , made them victims of Nazi eugenics\u2014developing an obsession with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence and atrocity .\nYoung men and boys often surround themselves with the fetishes of their favorite violent video games and films .\nIf there were any doubts that violent imagery increases aggression , the modern military wouldn \u2019 t use digital battle simulation in training recruits to kill .\nBut there \u2019 s another issue of extreme , uncharacteristic and delusory identification .\nColumbine shooter Dylan Klebold , though he was half Jewish , developed a sudden Nazi fixation after he reportedly began taking an unnamed antidepressant .\nFinnish shooter Auvinen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian border but paradoxically from a culture with historical resentment of violent Russian expansionism , also wove Stalinism into the sudden onset of his Celexa-induced , gun-worshipping violent delusions .\nBut Auvinen \u2019 s focus also included the Western psychotic staple\u2014Nazism .\nAs one Finnish drug critic put it when commenting on the Jokela school shooting , \u201c Now we know what put the \u2018 SS \u2019 in SSRI.\n\u201d Even the fact that Holmes\u2014 who spent summers as a nondenominational counselor for Camp Max Strauss serving underprivileged children\u2014suddenly identified with \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a departure from the trend .\nAnders Breivik is probably a red herring within the assessment since he was long associated with neo-Nazi organizations ; his ideology , though repulsive , was relatively cohesive and drawn from an organized militant movement .\nBut for the majority of modern mass killers , the focus on violent symbols might appear too random and disorganized to amount to any structured ideology .\nAccording to other documented cases of med madness , formerly agnostic or nonobservant individuals have developed an overnight belief in the devil .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of individuality , loss of empathy and the \u201c robot-like \u201d state induced by drugs which deactivate the frontal lobe .\nThis description of modern , drug-fueled mass killers has been as consistent as their pre-drug histories were not : Autism is sometimes clinically defined by \u201c lack of normal expressiveness , \u201d fixations on particular icons ( for instance , Thomas the Train ) , and various degrees of repetitive speech and choreiform movement which can sometimes give affected individuals a \u201c robotic \u201d appearance .\nLong before studies showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water or drugs in pregnancy were published , with the latter setting off speculations on future \u201c SSRI autism \u201d lawsuits , psychopharmaceutical critics had noted the \u201c autistic-like \u201d transformations of individuals under the influence of psychiatric drugs , particularly antidepressants , amphetamines and antipsychotics .\nBut the point of the observations was not that the subjects had been born this way .\nInstead it was understood that subjects were undergoing a sort of \u201c regression \u201d from expressive normalcy to OCD , robotic behavior , language and memory impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social withdrawal .\nThere \u2019 s a \u201c before \u201d and an \u201c after.\n\u201d It bears repeating that , unlike the relatively rare schizophrenic \u201c psychotic break \u201d in eras before prescription psychopharmaceuticals , the modern epidemic of psychosis more often involves immediately identifiable mitigating factors and vastly higher and more predictable rates of violence and suicide .\nEven the \u201c before and after \u201d has a before and after .\nAnother overlap with pharmaceutical brain injury which also doesn \u2019 t amount to a parallel to regressive infantile autism is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insufficiency\u2014which mounting research indicates may underlie autism and other modern chronic diseases which are also on the rise\u2014 may be at increased risk for experiencing drug-induced psychosis .\nIt \u2019 s uncertain why this may be so , though it \u2019 s known that certain psychiatric drugs impair mitochondrial function .\nIn The Silent Spring published forty years ago , Rachel Carson summarizes a chapter devoted to the mitochondrial-toxic effects of modern drugs and chemicals : Some of the defects and malformations in tomorrow \u2019 s children , grimly anticipated by the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be caused by these chemicals which permeate our outer and inner worlds .\nThere \u2019 s also the question of whether symptoms of chronic toxicity , either subclinical or full-blown , could fast track some children into biopsychiatric clutches in the first place .\nAll the same , even several mainstream , industry sponsored autism researchers and organizations agree that autism in itself has no clinical association to planned violence .\nFurthermore , individuals with autism are vastly underrepresented among perpetrators in crime statistics and those with mental or other disabilities are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to commit them .\nA Bureau of Justice Statistics report found that , \u2022 Persons age 12 or older who had disabilities experienced an estimated 567,000 nonfatal violent crimes in 2010 .\n\u2022 In 2010 , the age-adjusted violent victimization rate for persons with disabilities ( 28 violent victimizations per 1,000 ) was almost twice the rate among persons without disabilities ( 15 violent victimizations per 1,000 ) .\n\u2022 In 2010 , for both males and females the age-adjusted rate of violent crime was greater for those with disabilities than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for males with disabilities was 23 per 1,000 , compared to 16 per 1,000 for males without disabilities ; for females with disabilities the rate was 26 per 1,000 , compared to 15 per 1,000 for females without disabilities .\nThe above estimations are likely to be the tip of the iceberg .\nThere \u2019 s no data available on categories of disability ( cognitive , physical or a combination ) regarding disabled crime victims nor any data on disabled child victims of crime under the age of 12 .\nThis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Us and law enforcement response specialist Carolyn Gammicchia attempted to address through yearly formal requests for data gathering programs from the Department of Justice and the federal Office for Victims of Crime since 2005 .\nSo far , no program has been put in place and the holes in the data remain .\nGammicchia \u2019 s organization did uncover that 50 % of disabled victims never seek legal or medical assistance , more than half the crimes against the disabled are perpetrated against those with more than one type of disability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10 times more likely to be victims of criminal acts than the general population\u2014 far higher than the estimated twofold risk of victimization faced by the disabled population as a whole .\nCognitive injuries also open the door to psychiatric abuse .\nThis may have been true of John Ogdren and Sky Walker Steuernagel .\nWould they have had autism if not for environmental factors ?\nWould they have killed if they had not exposed to further environmental factors\u2014 drugs with black box warnings for violence and suicide ?\nWould Ogdren and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developmental disorders ?\nThe answer to the last question is that they might have been medicated even without serious disabilities .\nMany American children are , whether this happens because , as Breggin wrote , a child is bright and bored in a mediocre school , suffering from moderate lead or mercury exposure , traumatic stress , closed head injury , simply due to minority status or any number of reasons .\nBut even though the cognitively disabled are drugged at a far higher rate than the general population and would predictably experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of drug-fueled killers had no remarkable preexisting mental disability .\nThough several mass killers had come from troubled backgrounds , there \u2019 s no evidence this was true of the whole .\nThe common denominator for med madness is not necessarily genetics or \u201c partly life \u201d : not autism , not preexisting conditions , not even horrific childhoods .\nReading the comments \u2019 sections of articles on school/mass shootings , one sees members of the public conjecturing on the rumored autism of Virginia Tech killer Seung-Hui Cho .\nReading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill , there are frequent references to school shootings .\nAnd in the previously mentioned film We Need to Talk About Kevin , the communal musings are brought together into a neat little PR bomb .\nWhat these two issues\u2014mass murder and autism\u2014 may have in common , mostly , is that they \u2019 re becoming systematically blurred in public perceptions and there \u2019 s a method to it .\nJoe Scarborough \u2019 s remarks on Fox were not off the cuff and neither were Sean Hannity \u2019 s .\nWhen pharmaceutical front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s statements , this was not an accident .\nThere \u2019 s something in the message that \u2019 s important to media sponsors and to mainstream public health authorities .\nAlong the same bipartisan lines mentioned earlier , liberals are hardly immune from drawing sociopathic parallels to autism .\nIn an op-ed railing against conservative self-centeredness , liberal pundit Paul Wallis recites a list of hateful conservative views , including \u201c Ethnic groups are criminals , \u201d \u201c The poor are criminals , \u201d \u201c Obstructing any type of assistance to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] procedure , \u201d \u201c Sick people only get sick to take money away from the rich , \u201d and then adds : Can this possibly be considered anything but an autistic viewpoint ?\nEven the lying is based on the same mentality as a 2 year old who thinks they can get away with anything .\nApparently anything which doesn \u2019 t directly benefit or relate to oneself isn \u2019 t on the conservative radar .\nThat \u2019 s autism , incarnate .\nIf there \u2019 s one area of bipartisan agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus , it \u2019 s that \u201c autism incarnate \u201d is criminal incarnate .\nAdriana Gamondes is a contributing editor to Age of Autism and a Facebook page administrator .\nShe and her husband commute between Massachusetts and Florida and are the proud parents of recovering twins .\nDisclaimer : Withdrawal from psychotropic drugs can often be more dangerous than continuing on a medication .\nIt is

and media careers , and this may partly be because , as with the elusive schizophrenia \u201c genes , \u201d so many reputations and articles of scientific faith hinge on the theory .\nFor instance , if a group of researchers needs to prove that pigs fly to serve an industrial sponsor or as part of an exercise in `` weaponized anthropology \u201d targeting a strategic or ideological foe , all they

provides an endless supply of unsubstantiated genetic corollaries which have the distinction of being protected by the state in order to obfuscate the role of government public health agencies in contributing to an epidemic .\nAnd , of course , these unsubstantiated genetic corollaries have endless applications for political and industrial exploits .\nAutism , the fastest growing developmental disorder in the US , represents more than 7 % of a $ 40 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly 1 to 2 % of individuals under age 25 , where roughly 85 % of autism diagnoses are found .\nMarking a condition as a public safety hazard and those with the traits as near devils is the time honored manner of manufacturing public consent for exploitative and coercive treatment and dehumanization .\nIn other words , a wide belief that those with autism are likely to kill could effectively snuff protest against drugging mandates which Torry , Satel , Koplewicz , NAMI , the American Psychiatric Association , the National Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of presidential administrations and the pharmaceutical industry have pushed for all along .\nOne example of the use of an \u201c autism shield \u201d arose from research defining the Maori in New Zealand as genetically violent due to the so-called \u201c Warrior Gene . ''\nViewed through the lens of Weaponizing Anthropology author David H. Price , social scientists conducting portions of the ongoing Dunedin Multidisciplinary Study\u2014which turned 30 in 2012\u2014 might appear to have been `` unleashed '' for a particular mission .\nIn the case of Dunedin , the campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a corporate war to gain access to oil and gas reserves on Maori tribal lands .\nAnd so when the MacArthur Foundation funded the Law and Neuroscience project promoting \u201c Minority Report \u201d style programs to identify and cull the \u201c genetically violence prone \u201d before they endanger entire regions and the planet , it was quite natural to try to link the \u201c Warrior Gene '' or monoamine oxidase A ( MAOA ) gene to other target groups for various agendas : Associating the \u201c Warrior Gene \u201d to African Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and continuing economic disparity ; associating the \u201c Warrior Gene \u201d to Africans and Asians might justify Western competition against China to exploit African oil , etc .\nNot surprisingly , the credibility-shielding sealant was added to the MAOA theory when in his book , The Science of Evil : On Empathy and the Origins of Human Cruelty , UK autism researcher Simon Baron-Cohen attempts to cast violent psychopathology\u2014by way of \u201c Warrior Gene \u201d research\u2014as a genetic cousin to autism via another hypothesis , the \u201c zero empathy \u201d theory .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothingly asserts , is that individuals with autism don \u2019 t intend the harm they do whereas the nondisabled zero-empathy gene carriers , though they really can \u2019 t help it either , do intend harm .\nWhat possible difference this would make in terms of public safety response to these marked populations if the ideas were presumed true and manifested as policy is an issue which Baron-Cohen washes his hands of with a few bids for clemency for these genetic burdens on our race .\nIn Eugenics and Other Evils originally published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and philosopher G.K. Chesterton described individuals who separate themselves from the policy consequences of their conceptual campaigns\u2014the \u201c Eugenicist as Autocrat \u201d : If you let loose a law , it will behave as a dog does .\nIt will obey its own nature , not yours .\nSuch sense as you have put into the law ( or the dog ) will be fulfilled .\nBut you will not be able to fulfill a fragment of anything you have forgotten to put into it .\nBaron-Cohen repeatedly assures readers of his noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If his campaign feeds questionable policy and it all ends badly , he may argue that he didn \u2019 t intend for it to .\nSeeing hypotheses \u201c misbehave \u201d in application is an ironic risk embedded in the theory of genetic empathy or genetic-lack-thereof which also led premier \u201c psychopathology \u201d expert Robert Hare to lament judicial misuse of his \u201c Psychopathology Checklist \u201d in an NPR interview .\nStill , Hare makes no effort to disclaim the genetic theories which , as he admits himself , make his diagnostic instrument especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m very concerned about the inappropriate use of this instrument for purposes that have serious implications for the individual and for society .\nSPIEGEL : Still , use of the test continues to spread .\nIt \u2019 s now even mandated in several states .\nAnd the test has helped cause a shift in our ideas about where crime comes from , as well .\nThe idea that criminal behavior is primarily a product of poor environments has much less power today , in part because Hare \u2019 s work seemed to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that inborn personality traits like empathy can influence whether people participate in crime .\nBob Hare .\nMr. HARE : Empathy is highly genetic in origin , modified and shaped by the environment , of course .\nBut if you \u2019 ve got an adult who has virtually no empathy in the normal sense of the term , you \u2019 re not going to send him to school to learn empathy , Empathy 101 .\nIt \u2019 s just not going to work .\nSPIEGEL : And when you think about criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are almost genetically predisposed to crime , you are much less likely to invest in their rehabilitation than if you saw their acts as a product of unfortunate environmental circumstances .\nThis is why it \u2019 s so important to figure out if bias and bad training are affecting Hare \u2019 s test to the point that it is potentially mislabeling people .\nAfter all , once someone is labeled as a psychopath , what can you do with him ?\nNothing but lock him away .\nMainstream media has attempted to popularize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science writer Josh Horgan noted in Scientific American : Just when you think the blame-it-on-our-genes craze can \u2019 t get worse , the \u201c warrior gene \u201d goes viral .\nThe latest media outlet to flog it is the Dr. Phil show , which on April 4 broadcast \u201c Born to Rage ?\n\u201c .\nFrom the promo : \u201c Scientists believe they may know why some people are quicker to anger than others .\nA new study suggests that inside a rageaholic \u2019 s DNA , \u2018 a warrior gene \u2019 may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s guests be genetically predisposed to fits of fury ?\n\u201d \u2026 This cheesy talk show is hardly alone in hyping the warrior gene .\nIn fact , Dr. Phil borrowed his headline from a recent National Geographic broadcast , \u201c Born to Rage ?\n\u201c , which also explores \u201c the disturbing possibility that some people are born to rage.\n\u201d The show follows Henry Rollins , a self-described former punk rocker with a nasty temper , as he interviews \u201c outlaw bikers , mixed\u2013martial arts fighters \u201d and other tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head .\nIn 2007 Rod Lea and Geoffrey Chambers , researchers at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand , reported that MAOA-L [ alleles with \u201c low expression \u201d of MAOA are linked to higher rates of violence and Antisocial Personality Disorder ] occurs in 56 percent of Maori men .\n\u201c It is well recognized , \u201d the researchers commented in The New Zealand Medical Journal , \u201c that historically Maori were fearless warriors.\n\u201d The researchers \u2019 racial profiling was based on a study of 46 men , who needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined as Maori .\nLea and Chambers reported that MAOA-L was less common among Caucasians ( 34 percent ) and Hispanics ( 29 percent ) but even more common among Africans ( 59 percent ) and Chinese ( 77 percent ) .\nBaron-Cohen laments the same risk of \u201c misapplications \u201d as Hare , though neither complains when their genetic empathy theories are liberally applied to generalizations of modern non-ideological , \u201c inexplicable \u201d massacres\u2014speaking of things which end badly .\nThis brings up the question of whether these scientists are even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleashing .\nIn The Science of Evil Baron-Cohen offers only a surface review of the theoretical underpinnings of the \u201c zero empathy \u201d conception , including the MAOA criminal \u201c Warrior Gene \u201d theory , and tries to downplay evidence that the gist of the overall body of work supporting the MAOA theory is unambiguously racialist .\nThe fact that the Maori are the sole ethnic group Baron-Cohen mentions in association with the gene merely amplifies his squeamish awareness of the implications .\nFor example , Reti et al .\nattempted to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the MAOA gene\u2014a 2-repeat allele\u2014correlates to violence without association with childhood abuse .\nLike Baron-Cohen \u2019 s book , the study is rich in egalitarian qualifiers but the real story being sold is tucked within the stats .\nThe authors claim that 2-repeat or \u201c low expression \u201d alleles are nearly ten times more frequent among African American males\u20144.7 % of whom , according to the authors , carry the most dangerous or \u201c low expression \u201d 2-repeat allele\u2014 than white males\u2014 0.5 % of whom , according to authors , carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also being associated with gang membership\u2014the \u201c gang-gene.\n\u201d As a researcher who deeply influences public and institutional policy regarding autism and is actively setting up a theory franchise on criminality , if Baron-Cohen does not wish readers to assume he supports a racialist conception of violence or the enactment of policies based upon these conceptions , he might not have \u201c forgotten \u201d to cite arguments which run counter to his support sources , such as Zammit et al.\n\u2019 s critique of the MAOA hypothesis , Misconceptions about gene\u2013environment interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the monoamine oxidase A gene ( MAOA ) and childhood maltreatment on antisocial and violent behaviour in males was reported,17 such that the effect of maltreatment was greater with the low-activity variants of MAOA compared to those with high activity .\nAgain , this relationship was greater than multiplicative .\nOf 11 studies that have since examined this in males ( see online supplement ) , only 4 have examined whether this relationship was indeed greater than multiplicative .\nOf these , 3 found no evidence for such a relationship , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1-tailed p value .\nOf 10 studies that examined additive models , 5 reported evidence of a greater than additive effect ( 2 of these in subgroup analyses only ) , 4 found no evidence and 1 found evidence of an interaction but in the opposite direction to that originally reported .\nIn samples that also included females , 1 study examined a multiplicative relationship and found an interaction in the opposite direction .\nOf 6 studies that examined additive models , 2 found evidence of a greater than additive effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found an effect in the opposite direction .\nStudies finding , or failing to find evidence of interaction were equable in size .\nIn the closing passage of his 1998 book , Murderous Science : Elimination by Scientific Selection of Jews , Gypsies , and Others in Germany , 1933-1945 , Cologne geneticist Benno Muller-Hill leaves readers with a final warning that MAOA gene research would likely be where the \u201c new eugenics \u201d reared its head .\nFor unknown reasons , when Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press republished Muller-Hill \u2019 s book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wissenschaft .\nDie Aussonderung von Juden , Zigeunern und Geisteskranken 1933-1945\u2014 was changed in a way that dulled the impact ofthe author \u2019 s essential premise : rather than \u201c Others , \u201d the final category in theoriginal German title , \u201c Geisteskranken , \u201d literally translates as \u201c the insane , \u201d aka , the mentally disabled .\nThe omission is a bit stunning since Muller-Hill \u2019 s book is widely considered the first comprehensive chronicle of the mass extermination of the disabled under Nazi eugenic policies .\nBut the editorial blunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental disability in a litany of targets of eugenic racialism isn \u2019 t surprising considering that the current direction of commercial genetics grossly contradicts the deep-seated need of modern commercial science to characterize its campaigns as humanistic , enlightened and unbiased : continuing \u201c weaponized \u201d research against specifically racial groups often cut its teeth on weaponized research targeting the disabled and vice-versa .\nBaron-Cohen is deeply alarmed when critics infer he \u2019 s a eugenicist policy shill .\nGiven the implications of Baron-Cohen \u2019 s choice of supporting sources and disavowal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theories , it \u2019 s fascinating that he feels the need to step clear of the intended targets by assuring his readers in the book \u2019 s dedication that , quite unlike the Maori ( and , implicitly , other less favored ethnicities ) , violent psychopaths and individuals with autism , he is genetically bequeathed with empathy which he equates to a \u201c pot of gold \u201d inherited from his grandmother .\nIt \u2019 s become very fashionable for autism and mental health pundits to brandish a badge of \u201c empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness for the role of institutional policy maker .\nIn an interview for Gelf Magazine in 2009 , vaccine defender , front group blogger , overnight autism expert and Panic Virus author Seth Mnookin , who relies on Baron-Cohen \u2019 s work in his support sources , waves his own \u201c empathy \u201d badge at the proverbial genetic ivory tower security scanner : \u201c I find myself being incredibly empathetic ; it \u2019 s very easy for me to see the world from someone \u2019 s perspective .\nI find myself bending over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side\u2026 \u201d It \u2019 s also fascinating how small this world of euphemistic autocrats becomes once the focus is narrowed to the supposed \u201c bridge \u201d between autism and violence genes : one of the lead authors of a phase of Dunedin Maori research cited by science writer Josh Horgan was Sir Michael Rutter\u2014 another \u201c impaired empathy/autism \u201d expert .\nThis is the same Sir Michael Rutter who acted as star witness against Dr. Andrew Wakefield at the General Medical Council proceeding , as well as the same who balked at discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap on autistic subjects\u2014 since Rutter himself had performed precisely this type of research years earlier .\nRutter was co-author of the book , Sex Differences in Antisocial Behavior : Conduct Disorder , Deliquency and Violence in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study along with husband-wife researchers Avshalom Caspi and Terrie Moffit , whose work the MAOA \u201c Warrior Gene \u201d theory is pinioned on .\nIt \u2019 s curious , given the focus on empathy , that extreme poverty and rampant , enduring racial discrimination in New Zealand were not featured as identifiable contributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c mood disorder \u201d or \u201c depressive disease \u201d , i.e.\n, sadness , among the Maori of Dunedin\u2014just as Baron-Cohen and institutional and commercial scientists refuse to correlate pharmaceuticals to modern epidemics .\nThe autism epidemic is useful as a fear pitch for a range of ideological and product campaigns because the condition itself and the shock value of visible prevalence blind the public with terror\u2013 but only as long as the terrifying numbers are not actually identified as \u201c epidemic.\n\u201d Instead the public are being told they \u2019 re simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer hidden in institutions in our perhaps excessively ( it \u2019 s implied , given the supposed danger ) empathic and magnanimous age .\nBut if the public believes that autism can happen in any family\u2014which a genuine rise implies\u2014 those whose families are not yet impacted are less likely to support coercive management of affected or dubiously \u201c genetically related \u201d populations on the chance they could be condemning members of their own family one day .\nIn short , coercive approaches and demonization might be frustrated by a prevailing \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go I \u201d perception .\nAs an officially sanctioned and protected sealant for weaponized genetics\u2014 one that can not be peeled off , inspected or questioned\u2014aligning any condition to autism can be used to designate certain groups of people as inherently dangerous , lacking in empathy , less worthy and therefore exploitable and disposable .\nBlack and white , angels and devils , us and them\u2014the all-purpose absolutes which have served every form of social coercion , political turf battle , preemptive war and expansionism from time immemorial .\nIf history is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealant \u201d is applied for these purposes , the more good research money will go after bad and the more violently the doctrine will be defended until it becomes a sacrosanct core of institutional ideology .\nAnyone who believes in separation of church and state should be seriously concerned .\nThere \u2019 s no way around it : in terms of industry and institutional science , autism is becoming the \u201c mark of the devil \u201d along with the classic frothing finger-pointers differentiating their own worthy credentials .\nAs an estimated three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every week in US schools and institutions due to abusive practices ; as the news reports more and more children with autism arrested in schools , brutalized by police , denied organ transplants , found face down in ponds and subjected to a lottery for services ; and as disability services around the country are trimmed to the bone ; as the US drops to # 49 on the world infant mortality index ; as 1 in 8 children of Somali immigrants in Minnesota are diagnosed with autism and the national rate soars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as toddlers are drugged with increasing frequency , the act of binding together every frightening human impulse and condition with the \u201c autism sealant \u201d also protects societal conscience : we can cut our losses because the bulk of human evil can be found rolled up in a few tidy gene sequences which science has become suddenly divinely adept at identifying .\nBaron-Cohen argues , \u201c \u2026rather than there being some runaway escalation of autism , we have year by year simply become better at detection.\n\u201d Since there \u2019 s no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to explain away the catastrophic rise in autism and a nearly parallel rise in violent insanity as due to increased recognition or diagnostic substitution seem like a genomic version of the End of Days , complete with genetically determined zero-empathy massacrists as a sort of collective Anti-Christ and the scientific Second Coming separating the genetically worthy wheat from the genetically unworthy chaff in a ramped up selection .\nThe Enlightened Rapture has come at last .\nEven the genetically founded \u201c self-esteem \u201d campaign promoted by some high functioning adult self-advocates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same schema .\nBy denying the existence of an epidemic or that the majority of those affected are not high functioning and often suffer early mortality , and by drafting dead celebrities like Einstein and Mozart to autism in order to portray the condition as a type of technologically proficient genetic master race that has always existed and is responsible for nearly all human innovation , neurodiverse are basically characterizing themselves as something akin to the Wise Virgins : the chosen who lead the Ascension to a progressive , techno-centric paradise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own ranks .\nOddly enough , in the Book of Revelations , the unfit are those deemed too \u201c foolish \u201d to power up their gadgets .\nIn real life , a self advocate member of the neurodiversity movement and panel member of the federal Inter-agency Autism Coordinating Committee ( IACC ) voted against a medical code for deadly wandering among children with more severe or debilitating forms of autism on the grounds that such a code might impinge on `` self determination '' and issued objections to autism being framed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ICD-9 code and `` Silver Alert '' only for adults with dementia , for whom wandering is considered a potential feature of the medical condition , though no medical code for parents to provide to schools , state programs or insurers to access services and resources for affected children who , though many may be on the severe end of the spectrum , frequently display Houdini-ish skills in breaching locked windows , doors and gated yards or may bolt so quickly from caretakers that they 're able to wander into danger .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't qualify for Amber Alerts , though weekly reports of deaths by drowning and exposure have become seasonal norms in the US .\nAlthough 90 % of autism parents polled reported their affected children have wandered into harm \u2019 s way , the neurodiverse disdain the claim that the majority of individuals with autism are so impaired that they lack the self determination to prevent them from bolting onto a highway at night or into an icy lake .\nFurthermore , requisite data collection for an ICD-9 code would prove that the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals is a very new phenomenon .\nBut this statistical reality of autism clashes with the neurodiverse view of autism as simply a genetic `` difference '' that has always existed and is even , in adaptive genetic terms , superior in some ways .\nAnd so the `` Wise Virgins '' deny resources to the `` foolish '' and do n't speak up when God/government denies their existence .\nBut the neurodiverse view fails to grasp that the creation of genetic castes is the underpinning of any tribalist social order by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed of\u2014 cast into the lake , so to speak , where children with autism are too often found face-down and dead .\nIt \u2019 s more than a little ironic that the neurodiverse frequently pin their genetic defenses and denial of environmental cause on the work of commercial scientists like Baron-Cohen , Sir Michael Rutter and Michael Fitzgerald who , out of the other sides of their mouths , promote various versions of the zero empathy association .\nBut if ignoring the suffering of the least fortunate were simply chalked up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autism lack empathy , it doesn \u2019 t seem to be much of a distinguishing feature since the same is typical in the field of autism research itself : it was just more \u201c casting into the lake of fire \u201d when commercial researchers fell on the \u201c vasopressin gene \u201d theory of ruthlessness and criminality and linked the concept to autism .\nEnvironmental pituitary damage may very well be a feature of the array of physiological injuries involved in autism since a rash of research has linked autism to reduced oxytocin\u2014 no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released into the blood via the pituitary from the same neurons as a key mechanism of the central autonomic network .\nWhatever the cause , some individuals with autism may have abnormal vasopressin .\nImpaired vasopressin may be a biomarker for Alzheimer \u2019 s as well .\nBeing tested could potentially save lives among those with or without cognitive disability because impaired vasopressin\u2014otherwise known as the antidiuretic hormone or ADH which is critical in preventing the body from squandering water from the kidneys when there \u2019 s a risk of dehydration or electrolyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , more extreme complications in autism-associated diseases like mastocytosis or death from hypernatremia , catabolic and hypovolemic stress .\nDetection and treatment of abnormal vasopressin would hardly be a cure-all for conditions with complex medical profiles like autism , but some believe it could partly explain incontinence in certain neurological syndromes , lowered seizure threshold , cardiac insufficiency and heat intolerance among other things .\nThere \u2019 s an old , relatively safe drug to treat it .\nBut because potential medical risks of low ADH were not included in the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research , many might be afraid to test for the marker .\nDuring the Second World War , on one side of the Russian Front lay absurd Nazi eugenic \u201c nature \u201d theories condemning the mentally and physically disabled as dangers to society and to the purity of the race ; on the other side lurked Stalinist promotion of Lamarckian genetics\u2014the idea that acquired personality traits ( e.g.\n, \u201c bourgeois corruption \u201d ) can be passed on to offspring , adulterating the purity of society .\nAs Pulitzer-winning journalist , political activist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in When Atheism Becomes Religion : America \u2019 s New Fundamentalism , both \u201c bad seed \u201d views , like two sides of the same coin , were used to rationalize torture , grotesque human experimentation and the wiping out of entire families and ethnicities on the concept that all evil lay within recognizably tainted evolutionary strains of human beings .\nThe terms \u201c totalitarian , \u201d \u201c fascist , \u201d etc.\n, are overused and worn thin as moral hostage takers in the current political climate , though as philosopher Tzvetan Todorov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisting danger of parareligious scientism .\nWhat appears to set 20th century totalitarianism apart from other historical instances of mass injustice is that the externalization of evil from \u201c us \u201d to \u201c them \u201d was justified in scientific-sounding language .\nConsidering the choices left to those with autism and families of environmentally injured children in calling for support for challenges and health issues , and considering the estimated six-fold increase in early mortality among affected individuals by a number of causes , many of them preventable , the autism community as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a battle front\u2014 caught between deadly \u201c scientific-sounding \u201d ideology to the east and more deadly \u201c scientific-sounding \u201d ideology to the west\u2014or left and right as the case may be .\nIn viewing autism , the demonizing pseudoscience\u2014the \u201c fronts \u201d \u2014 can be swapped and switched or sometimes combined according to convenience .\nAnd so a bastardized hybrid of Lamarckian and Mendelian genetics has come together in the recent theory that autism mothers are , as Bettelheim claimed , emotionally cold ( \u201c refrigerated \u201d ) , but due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sociopathic greed and violent psychopathology .\nDisclosure of actual medical ramifications and causes of impaired vasopressin could get in the way of marketing \u201c behavior control \u201d drugs for designated conditions , many of which reduce the expression of vasopressin/ADH , effectively increasing risk of the above complications .\nAlso mercury is known to impair vasopressin secretion from the pituitary\u2014a fact which , if disclosed , could lead to another profit inhibitor : prevention .\nBut more importantly , admitting to physiological injuries and medical complications in autism detracts from the purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marginalizing and targeting groups of people through the concept of \u201c genetically programmed devils.\n\u201d It \u2019 s only a matter of time before industry-sponsored teams of geneticists and social scientists attempt to link the \u201c vasopressin gene \u201d to other strategic foes or targets in order to justify exploiting their labor , taking their land or bombing them to Kingdom Come for oil or other resources .\nThe theories and choice of targets give away a great deal .\nEven the Manchurian candidate theory for mass shootings has an element of externalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of its engineers .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean the Hoover era drug and brainwashing experiments didn \u2019 t happen or that they aren \u2019 t continuing in some form\u2014 or even that current \u201c happy pills \u201d aren \u2019 t potentially the mass marketed end result of those now declassified social control experiments .\nBut what if the conscious intent of so many secondary agents pushing certain risky pharmaceuticals in our culture\u2014from school nurses to family doctors to public health officials\u2014is to \u201c help \u201d ?\nIn Why Progressives Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autism author and Editor Dan Olmsted wrote , Progressivism , the idea that government can and should intervene to improve the lives of its citizens , arose early in the last century in response to the Darwinian excesses of Industrial Revolution , laissez-faire capitalism \u2013 child labor , abject poverty in the elderly , untaxed corporate profits that went right back into the pockets of the richest .\nIt peaked during the New Deal , then plummeted during Reagan \u2013 \u201c Government is not the solution to the problem , government IS the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this political philosophy waxes and wanes , as it should , I would argue that the word has a wider meaning now \u2013 that our country , great as it is and has been , faces challenges and problems that can be addressed by doing something , by making progress , sometimes but not necessarily led or funded by government .\nSo it \u2019 s not so much a left-right issue as one of the static status quo versus the impulse to improve on it .\nThe \u201c conspiracy for good \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious motives can \u2019 t underlie benevolent intentions or that good intentions exonerate action , but if we endow the majority of capitulators with anything other than a devious conscious intent to control for the purposes of exploitation and destruction as part of some vast conspiracy , that would make them too much like us .\nThere are criminals in every institution and conspiracies exist , but these are always sold to the bulk of those carrying them out as necessary means to some beneficial end .\nThe point is that belief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic disorder or criminality articulates a universal human impulse to externalize and quarantine evil in order to feel assured of our complete separateness from it .\nThe plea of many humanist philosophers is that only through recognizing the universality of the impulse and the rationalizations it hides under can it be impeded .\nIf something can happen to anyone given various environmental conditions ( such as upbringing or trauma or toxic assault ) , it \u2019 s no longer possible to displace the capacity for defect , \u201c sin \u201d and crime or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d is really nothing other than a \u201c lurid parable \u201d for the externalization of evil .\nExternalization of evil is one of the earmarks of fundamentalist fanaticism as much as more serious theology and scientific inquiry , if they have anything in common , are defined by self-scrutiny and humility in facing , as Hedges puts it , that \u201c there are forces in the universe which will always lie beyond the capacity of the human mind.\n\u201d He argues that while more deeply considered theology and evolutionary theory share a view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , \u201d the ultimate mark of fundamentalism and the root of every utopian scheme that ever existed is the idea that the human race is \u201c perfectible.\n\u201d What would better sum up the pharmaceutical sales pitch other than the fanatical idea that we can drug or plan away everything that makes us human ?\nAnd the first step on the way to the shining future has always been the identification of those \u201c castes \u201d which hold back human progress and upon whom all human weakness and evil are externalized .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors which trigger violent impulses and cause suffering can \u2019 t be addressed in what 20th Century philosopher Karl Raimund Popper regarded as \u201c piecemeal social engineering \u201d as opposed to \u201c Utopian engineering , \u201d which Popper equates to Plato \u2019 s conception for the perfectibility of the race , the precursor of eugenics .\nIn The Open Society and Its Enemies : The Spell of Plato , Part 1 , Popper warns about the \u201c greater good \u201d doctrine : Before proceeding to criticize \u201c Utopian \u201d engineering in detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely that of piecemeal engineering .\nIt is an approach which I think to be methologically sound .\nThe politician who adopts this method may or may not have a blueprint of society before his mind .\nHe may or may not hope that humanity will reach an ideal state , and achieve happiness and perfection on earth .\nBut he will be aware that perfection , if at all attainable , is far distant , and that every generation of men , and also the living , have a claim ; perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there are no institutional means of making man happy , but a claim not to be made unhappy , where it can be avoided .\nThey have a claim to be given all possible help if they suffer .\nThe piecemeal engineer will , accordingly , adopt the message of searching for , and fighting against , the greatest and most urgent evils of society , rather than searching for , and fighting for , its greatest ultimate good .\nBut don \u2019 t certain drugs and biotechnologies alleviate suffering ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some , certain treatments may cause irreversible damage , increased suffering , disability or death .\nThe upshot of Popper \u2019 s discussion is that sacrificing the few for the \u201c greatest ultimate good \u201d is not justified in civil society , therefore whatever form of suffering-reduction is being proposed can \u2019 t be forced even if it \u2019 s offered as an option .\nThe controversy of parsing \u201c lesser evils \u201d in war will continue as long as there are wars , but social engineering is assumed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the prefix \u201c war on \u201d has been pasted to any forced domestic palliative campaign ( war on drugs , war on disease , war on mental illness , etc . )\n, not to mention questionable forms of foreign \u201c humanitarian aid \u201d in which the \u201c greater good \u201d rationale and the modified values of war are needed to pardon collateral human costs .\nInformed choice is a different matter .\nPeople who take psychoactive drugs often like the effects .\nThere are some conditions\u2014life threatening seizures or intractable self-injury\u2014which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options and , unless the current model is changed , are unlikely to be provided with safer or more effective options .\nThinking all human evil and all violent psychosis would disappear if these drugs were forever banned is a bit like saying the world would be perfect if only we could get rid of this damned utopianism .\nDrug induced violence would certainly be reduced if marketing were strictly limited , if firewalls were erected between regulatory agencies and industry and if consumers were stringently informed of risks and given wide access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always had and always will have an attraction to mind altering substances and to try to legislate against it is to legislate morality , something which Todorov describes as one of the three central linchpins of totalitarianism .\nAnd it doesn \u2019 t work .\nPrescribing doctors can \u2019 t make long term predictions over which individuals will go mad on drugs and they also can \u2019 t predict who won \u2019 t , though it \u2019 s become abundantly clear that the standard practice of seeing medicated patients twice or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renew prescriptions is a recipe for disaster .\nMoney plays an obvious role in the practice .\nBut as anthropologist Hugh Gusterson indicates in his study of atomic scientists , ascribing only the basest motives to a profession\u2014greed , dominance , the drive to express potency\u2014 isn \u2019 t actually the worst that can be said about it because the view ignores the ideology and rationalizations underlying the euphemization of risks , romanticization of technology and exaggerated self-assurance that this technology can be controlled even in the face of repeat error and loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAmong the identifying factors which Popper uses to illustrate the difference between piecemeal and utopian social engineering are force , fraud and what Popper describes as the key element of fraud , the division of castes or \u201c racialism.\n\u201d All are in operation in the pharmaceutical paradigm where authorities are somehow endowed with the power to ensure that collateral is written off as well as denied .\nAccording to Popper , racialism is intrinsic to a social form of \u201c historicism \u201d \u2014 the idea that history is essentially controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery would enable us to prophesy the destiny of man.\n\u201d \u201c Historicism \u201d \u2014the pursuit of the secret scientific formula which would supposedly endow the few with the tools to direct the fate of all\u2014 is based on a genealogical caste system separating the inherently inferior from the inherently superior , with the latter supposedly ( divinely or through superior evolution ) \u201c chosen \u201d to decide which is which and to lead humanity to perfection and transcendence .\nPopper proposes that racialism\u2014a key part of the \u201c organic theory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what Plato rationalized as the \u201c noble lie \u201d imbuing the propaganda and fraud necessary to sell utopian schemes in service of power : Concerning the use of lies and deceit , Plato urges that these are \u201c useful only as medicine \u201d , but the ruler of the state , Plato insists , must not behave like those \u201c ordinary doctors \u201d who have not the courage to administer strong medicine .\nThe philosopher king\u2026must be determined to administer \u201c a great many lies and deceptions \u201d \u2014for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhich means , as we already know , and as we may learn here again from Plato \u2019 s reference to medicine , for the benefit of the state .\nWhat kind of lies has Plato in mind when he exhorts his rulers to use strong medicine ?\nCrossman rightly emphasizes that Plato means \u201c Propaganda , the technique of controlling\u2026the bulk of the ruled majority \u201d \u2026 \u201d by means of both persuasion and force.\n\u201d Like beauty pageant contestants , everyone hopes for world peace and a shining future for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens with utopian schemes , the promise of fantastic transformation , for which the public were persuaded to trade rights and freedoms , begins to crumble under abuse of power and the sheer emptiness of claims , force kicks in .\nAs Orwell elaborated , \u201c All tyrannies rule through fraud and force , but once the fraud is exposed , they must rely exclusively on force.\n\u201d In marketing certain pharmaceutical drugs and technologies , persuasion often is fraud .\nIn 2005 , a research team directed by Dr. John Ioannidis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demonstrated that there \u2019 s less than a 50 % chance that the results of any randomly chosen scientific paper will be true .\nA Cochrane Collaboration analysis discovered that industry funded studies are reviewed more favorably by medical journals even when the studies were of poor quality ( cited by Mercola ) .\nJon Jureidini , head of the Department of Psychological Medicine at Women \u2019 s and Children \u2019 s Hospital in Adelaide , Australia , found corruption and fraud running through every stage of bringing forth blockbuster drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAs for the \u201c genetic underpinnings \u201d of disease and psychiatric disorders , a large number of findings turn out to be false .\nBut rather than being subject to retractions , findings are often recycled or researchers tweak data until they achieve their desired results .\nIn a special report for The Guardian entitled , Genetic \u2018 Breakthroughs \u2019 in Medicine Are Often Nothing of the Sort , psychologist Marcus Munaf\u00f2 and geneticist Jonathan Flint write : In the years following media coverage of discoveries of a gene for depression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals less prestigious than Science or Nature often publish reports that contradict the original claim , some even saying that the findings are quite compatible with chance .\n\u2026so many high-profile findings can be explained by chance alone that one genetic epidemiologist , John Ioannidis , has taken on the task of explaining , `` Why most published research findings are false '' 4 .\nSome of the reasons are due to the misuse of statistics and poor study design , but what Ioannidis and others now looking at this problem also point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThese contribute to his claim that : '' The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field , the less likely the research findings are to be true .\nThe hotter a scientific field ( with more scientific teams involved ) , the less likely the research findings are to be true . ''\nEven as the American Psychiatric Association protests that they can not be held responsible for a patient \u2019 s actions because they can not predict those actions , organized psychiatry advises state and federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in mental health policy .\nOrganized psychiatry also guides jurisprudence on public safety and death penalty cases , often on the basis of deeply flawed genetic research or , as The Guardian flatly stated , perjury .\nThey are policy makers endowed with the awesome power to pull the strings of life and death .\nTo quote Popper again , What a monument of human smallness is this idea of the philosopher king .\nWhat a contrast between it and the simplicity of humaneness of Socrates , who warned the statesmen against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own power , excellence , and wisdom , and who tried to teach him what matters most \u2014 that we are all frail human beings .\nWhat a decline from this world of irony and reason and truthfulness down to Plato \u2019 s kingdom of the sage whose magical powers raise him high above ordinary men ; although not quite high enough to forgo the use of lies , or to neglect the sorry trade of every shaman \u2014 the selling of spells , of breeding spells , in exchange for power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the promise of paradise ; and scientism sells the idea through a \u201c vulgarization \u201d of Darwin \u2019 s theory in service to a Platonic style of racialism : the laughable concept that select human beings are destined to teleologically evolve\u2014i.e.\n, evolve for the better .\nWhat \u2019 s more , scientism demands the customary recognition of a wise caste among scientists who can accelerate this evolution through the wonders of modern chemistry and social engineering in order to make our species smarter , more rational , happier , healthier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the evolutionary vanguard claim of themselves , \u201c incredibly empathetic.\n\u201d Never mind the predictable body count of this particular social model .\n\u201c Empathy \u201d has become the trendy tagline for supposed degree of evolution from ape aggression or transcendence from \u201c original sin \u201d depending on whether the rationalization is framed as scientific or religious .\nBut in Efficiency , Sustainability , and Justice to Future Generations ( p. 68 ) , Klaus Mathis and Fabian Diriwachter write : The ability to put oneself in other people \u2019 s position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis circumstance must not blind us to the fact that empathy can be utilized for very different purposes .\nAn evolutionary benefit of empathy is thought to be that of understanding competitors in order to eliminate them more efficiently .\nSomeone with empathy can understand their counterpart more easily and therefore engage more effectively with their desires and interests .\nBut it is also empathy that helps the sadist to find out how to torture his victim with particular cruelty .\nOne could argue that enjoyment of pornography requires a type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not actually participating in the depicted scene yet somehow identifies with the excitement they imagine the participants experience\u2014which would include those who are titillated by depictions of cruelty and sadism .\nIn The Office and Philosophy : Scenes from the Unexamined Life , Jeremy Wisnewski argues , In everyday language , people tend not to discriminate between the kinds of empathy .\nBut philosophy is about being careful with words so that we do not confuse our concepts and get misled about our conclusions .\nFor example , one would normally say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis is somewhat misleading , since a psychopath who lacked cognitive empathy would be very frustrated .\nAfter all , if his goal were to harm or torture people , then he would not know whether or not he was doing it right !\nIt would seem then , that if he lacked anything it would be affective empathy\u2014he doesn \u2019 t truly feel the pain he is causing .\nSimon Baron-Cohen , in his review of We Need to Talk About Kevin , concedes that `` cognitive empathy '' or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or feeling , differs from \u201c affective empathy '' \u2014 the ability to feel what someone else is feeling .\nThe capacity for cognitive empathy in the absence of affective empathy would not rule out sadism and psychopathology in other words .\nBut even affective empathy , like any human faculty , is morally ambiguous , merely a color in a paint box : what defines it is what picture is painted with it as law professor Lynne Henderson suggests in Legality and Empathy : The reality of empathy is that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves , and that such empathic understanding may be so automatic that it goes unnoticed : elites will empathize with the experience of elites , men empathize with men , women empathize with women , whites with whites .\nI would call this \u2018 unreflective \u2019 empathy .\nAnd as empathy becomes a mark of the \u201c chosen \u201d and lack of it a diagnostic criterion of the damned , what picture does it paint ?\nAn unreflective division of castes , a replacement for fundamentalist interpretations of \u201c sin \u201d and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting off all sins onto designated societal scapegoats .\nThe cult of science does this by projecting all \u201c primitive \u201d destructiveness stemming from various genetic deficits\u2014original sins\u2014 to a less- or defectively-evolved grade of human .\nThis in itself is not a \u201c sin \u201d of course because investigators have \u201c bent over backwards \u201d to \u201c understand \u201d the targets .\nIn the same way that tribal cultures engage in \u201c totem meal \u201d rites of projecting all the sins of tribe members onto a sacrificial animal , when commercial science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d while participating in crusades against consumer freedom , what they really mean is something closer to a tribal ritual of identification\u2014 where the \u201c chosen \u201d dance around in the scapegoat \u2019 s skin a bit after cutting its throat .\nIn this sense , \u201c empathy \u201d has become the semantic stand-in for purity because \u201c sin , \u201d like the idea of swinging from a prehensile tail , has disappeared from the repertoire of the self-designated \u201c rationalist \u201d class .\nHedges defines sin as \u201c a stark acknowledgment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are bound and limited by human flaws and self-interest .\nThe concept of sin is a check on the utopian dream of a perfect world.\n\u201d In Kurt Vonnegut \u2019 s Cat \u2019 s Cradle , a character sums up the fatal flaw of his fictional father , Felix Hoenikker , the novel \u2019 s Oppenheimer-like \u201c Father of the Atom Bomb \u201d and one of the \u201c smartest scientists on Earth \u201d : There are lots of good anecdotes about the bomb and Father \u2026 For instance , do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they first tested a bomb out at Alamagordo ?\nAfter the things went off , after it was a sure thing that America could wipe out a city with just one bomb , a scientist turned to Father and said , \u2018 Science has now known sin.\n\u2019 And do you know what Father said ?\nHe said , \u2018 What is sin ?\n\u2019 Utopian cults baptize an immaculate earthly elite who justify force as the means to achieve a progressive paradise and the sacrifice or weeding out of the inferior for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite , according to the cult of science , are the more \u201c purely rational , \u201d supposedly freer of superstition , irrationality and magical thinking and somehow less bound by human flaws , self-interest and selfishness , therefore more effectively empathic .\nThe irony of the current scientific cult , like many religious cults , is that it ultimately rationalizes a preemptive withdrawal of mercy , \u201c empathy \u201d and basic civil rights from those classes of people who are diagnostically undeserving of self-determination because they \u2019 re deemed to intrinsically lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , collectively lacking in rational cognitive processing\u2014another \u201c deadly sin \u201d on the list of diagnostic vices\u2014 and therefore selfishly obstructive of the march to progress and the achievement of the greatest ultimate good for mankind .\nIn the past few years , there have been an increasing number of industry-supported \u201c weaponized sociology \u201d studies and subsequent media reports arguing that growing consumer dissidence against certain technological innovations like genetically modified crops , vaccines and psychiatric drugs stems from an irrational health belief model and that , furthermore , this tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be genetic .\nBoth \u201c Skeptic \u201d icon Richard Dawkins , author of The Selfish Gene , and Richard Brodie , former technical assistant to Bill Gates and author of Virus of the Mind : The New Science of the Meme , have advocated engineering evolution by manipulating social consciousness\u2014aka , \u201c memetic engineering \u201d \u2014 and thus guiding natural selection and evolution itself to eradicate irrationality and \u201c false belief \u201d from the species .\nMalcolm Gladwell has been accused of lifting the `` meme '' conception for his `` epidemic '' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Gladwell , possibly more of an opportunist than ideologue , shies slightly away from Dawkins ' proposal that thought and belief not only impact the evolution of ideas but may actually impact evolution itself .\nAs outrageous as it sounds , commercial science and the media are increasingly filled with true believers in the creed .\nImagine the horror of the Anti-Defamation League when on January 9th , 2009 , journalist Bill Moyers presented an argument about violence in Gaza entitled , Bill Moyers Reflects on Middle East Violence ( scroll to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gaza is the latest battle in the oldest family quarrel on record .\nOpen your Bible : the sons of the patriarch Abraham become Arab and Jew .\nGo to the Book of Deuteronomy .\nWhen the ancient Israelites entered Canaan their leaders urged violence against its inhabitants .\nThe very Moses who had brought down the commandment \u201c Thou shalt not kill \u201d now proclaimed , \u201c You must destroy completely all the places where the nations have served their gods .\nYou must tear down their altars , smash their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set fire to the carved images of their gods , and wipe out their name from that place\u2026So God-soaked violence became genetically coded .\nWherever one stands on the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\u2014and there are many Israelis and Palestinians who hope for an end to violence\u2014Moyers ' summary remark was ethically craven , aside from having no basis in science , history or anthropology .\nTzvetan Todorov makes the simple point that more human beings were killed in the name of science and twisted concepts of genetics in the twentieth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters in previous recorded history .\nOur ape ancestors , according to primatologist Richard Wrangham , committed routine lethal raids , cannibalism , rape , battering and infanticide .\nApes are not generally believed to be religious .\nThe fact that so many human lives have been squandered in religious conflicts throughout history simply makes the question of religion moot to the discussion .\nThe faculty of belief\u2014belief in anything\u2014 is just another color in the paint box .\nIt can paint pictures of courage and tolerance or arrogance and extremism .\nMoyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2004 in which Dawkins does his usual fish-in-a-barrel routine by highlighting the more extreme and destructive fanatical religious and paranormal views in order to comparatively prop up his own brand of \u201c rationalism , \u201d though Moyers avoids questioning Dawkins over the no less absurd idea of memetic engineering , a concept which Moyers later invokes with the \u201c God-soaked \u201d remark .\nThe picture that emerges from the utopian palette never seems to change .\nFor all its enlightened claims , the concept of memetic engineering doesn \u2019 t differ much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith that they would eventually be capable of transmuting lead into gold , alchemists sought to uncover an Elixir of Life\u2014a magic bullet to end all suffering , disease and death\u2014and divined that the human species could be permanently delivered from its imperfect state through thought and belief .\nInherent to the magical side of ancient alchemy , like in its modern practice in India , is the caste system .\nDawkins and other supporters of memetic evolution have watched as their theories \u201c evolve \u201d into literal application : the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThis has been taken to such fanatical heights that Dawkins \u2019 Skeptic comrade Sam Harris has called for the total annihilation of Islamic culture on the idea that believers are inherently tainted with violent ideology .\nLike Baron-Cohen \u2019 s cries of kinder-gentler intent in response to protests that his push for prenatal autism screening could bring about mass abortions , many members of the Skeptic front movement recently reacted to public criticism by momentarily distancing themselves from Harris \u2019 s more concrete interpretation of memetic evolution ( while still defending its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s \u201c Eugenicist as Euphemist \u201d : Most Eugenicists are Euphemists .\nI mean merely that short words startle them , while long words sooth them .\nAnd they are utterly incapable of translating the one into the other , however obviously they mean the same thing .\nSay to them \u201c The persuasive and even coercive powers of the citizen should enable

babies sent to sleep in cradles .\nSay to them \u201c Murder your mother , \u201d and they sit up quite suddenly .\nYet the two sentences , in cold logic , are exactly the same .\nDawkins pulls slightly short of blunt about his ideological aims : \u201c We , alone on earth , can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\n\u201d But Harris doesn \u2019 t euphemize at all : \u201c Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest people \u201d should \u201c destroy bad ideas \u201d ( and apparently their \u201c bad \u201d human vectors ) where they find them .\nDawkins and his Skeptic/radical atheist followers demonstrate that there \u2019 s no better cover for a secular form of fundamentalist historicism than externalizing and generalizing the same fanatical paradigm solely to groups which self-identify as non-secular\u2014extremist members of which have frequently also been guilty of externalizing all evil to nonbelievers .\nBoth extremes fail to account for historical acts of valor and selflessness committed by the ideological opposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were performed under their own banner .\nIt doesn \u2019 t take a PhD to recognize that the degree to which any religious or secular ideology purports more than symbolic infallibility in select ( honest ) human beings\u2014at least sufficient sinlessness to condemn others without rigorous due process\u2014 is also the degree to which it \u2019 s cult-like .\nThe tribal caste conceit is hard to escape\u2014it exists to some extent in every human institution and is reflected in commonplace impulses like celebrity worship .\nIn Escape from Evil , anthropologist Ernest Becker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpitate at the sight of an admired idol .\nHow do we know we \u2019 re each endowed with \u201c dark \u201d as well as \u201c light \u201d ?\nAside from the simple fact of being human , Becker indicates that our primitive humanity can be measured by those worshipful palpitations .\nViewing some human beings as virtually transcendent gives hope and can fuel aspirations .\nAnd it \u2019 s entertaining .\nBut the dark side of the same impulse is the usual division of castes and dangerous reverence for authority .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My kingdom is not of this world \u201d can be taken as an allegorical warning that perfection can not be found in any human institution .\nWhen the idea is projected into a hereafter or , for secular purposes , to a far off goal of social engineering as Popper describes , it fulfills a common human need for hope in addressing social ills and human suffering .\nBut all cults promise previews\u2014transcendence in the here and now and naturally an elite which will decide who is or is not in \u201c the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commercial science has anointed a higher order endowed with special wisdom in gauging by DNA who is \u201c Round-Up Ready \u201d enough to join the worthy on the march to a shining future and who shall be cursed to the fire of disability , disease , dangerous insanity and extinction .\nSecular or not , scientific fanaticism is still a form of faith , but one which , like any cult , creates angels and devils in earthly form .\nWhy continue the pretense that this isn \u2019 t an alternative religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devils and divine messengers ?\nHence the ultimate cheap gimmick\u2014the Frau Koma avatar\u2014on which to project all the pseudo-rationalist absolutes .\nThe argument isn \u2019 t new .\nAs mid-twentieth century philosopher and originator of the \u201c Serenity Prayer \u201d Reinhold Niebuhr warns in The Irony of American History and in The Children of Darkness and the Children of Light , the creation of absolutes and the externalization of evil are the means by which we inadvertently take on the evil attributes we project onto ideological foes .\nHe warns that this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combine the human need for transcendence by offering a paradise on earth , which invariably leads to the use of power without scruples under an illusion that a particular \u201c conception of an unambiguously ideal end \u201d justifies such abuse : \u201c As politics deals with the proximate ends of life , and religion deals with ultimate ones , it is always a source of illusion when the one is invested with the other\u2026This unification is spurious and dangerous ; but this in fact adds to , rather than detracts from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are combined in such a way that the modern cult of science is brought completely into the service of an existential faith.\n\u201d In his book on technological and progressive fanaticism , When Atheism Becomes Religion , Hedges reiterates Niebuhr \u2019 s warning for modern application : \u201c Those who , in the name of science , claim that we can overcome our imperfect human nature create a belief system that functions like religion .\nIt gives meaning .\nIt gives purpose and hope .\nBut it is a myth .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you cut through their scientific jargon , to support their absurd propositions.\n\u201d Vonnegut asks , \u201c See the cat ?\nSee the cradle ?\n\u201d Todorov , also cited by Hedges , defines scientism\u2014the \u201c religion \u201d of science\u2014 as the campaign to create a paradise on earth by \u201c curing humanity of its criminal instincts \u201d and warns further that scientism is an intrinsic element of totalitarian doctrine : \u201c At a particular point in history , however , a conjunction occurred bringing together several preexisting strands : revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the millenarian dream of building an earthly paradise here and now ; and the pseudoscientific doctrine asserting that complete knowledge of the human species was about to become available .\nThe moment of this meeting marks the birth of totalitarian ideology.\n\u201d Members of the new \u201c rationalist \u201d front who issue organized defenses of commercial genetics and pharmaceutical policies are fond of quoting Karl Popper \u2019 s scientific theories , though they tend to steer clear of his social hypotheses because Popper is unequivocal on the irrelevance of whether certain utopian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in either case , any attempts to apply these types of theories to society are , as Popper warns , \u201c veiled forms of propaganda to return to tribalism.\n\u201d When rationalized as a scientific crusade for the betterment of humanity , mystical , caste-dependent tribalism\u2014with its scapegoating rites and totem meals to displace evil and achieve the purity of the tribe\u2014 is simply a veiled bid for totalitarianism .\nIn this sense , there \u2019 s nothing more politically ominous than the hunt to identify the born killer .\nMuch more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions like autism and mass murdering psychosis is the similarity between modern drug-fueled massacrists and their creators : what \u2019 s shared by those in the throes of violent side effects and those whose pseudoscientific doctrine led to the forceful marketing of harmful pharmaceutical products is a sort of \u201c avenging angel \u201d or avatar delusion leading some to expedite a virtual \u201c day of reckoning.\n\u201d Elements of this are reflected in the totalitarian or fundamentalist symbol-fragments that so many of the chemically-driven mass killers may suddenly identify with .\nBoth creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixing \u201d the world by taking power over the unworthy , no matter what scale is used to judge other human beings and find them wanting .\nBoth imagine themselves to possess a supernatural ability to identify the inherently \u201c bad strains \u201d who can no longer be reached by human means .\nBoth ultimately move towards the use of force\u2014 one through fraud and mandated treatment , the other with bullets .\nErich Fromm wrote in The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness , \u201c As long as one believes that the evil man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evil man.\n\u201d

''\nDr. Moskowitz is truthful , gentle ( I 've had the privilege of meeting him ) and fearless .\n# # # Even more striking is the prevalence of chronic disease in children , presumably our healthiest demographic .\nIn 2008 , a study of 91,000 children found that 43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 of the 20 chronic diseases surveyed , and that adding obesity and neuropsychiatric disturbances to the list raised the total to a shocking 54.1 % of all children afflicted with some form of chronic disease.12 The most dramatic increases that I personally witnessed in my practice fall under the general heading of brain dysfunction , including ADHD , autism , dyslexia , and sensory , motor , learning , and developmental disabilities , all relatively uncommon when I began practicing in the late 1960 's , and only slightly less so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '80 's , all of them have been spreading rapidly , to the point that in 2017 the National Center for Learning Disabilities reported that approximately 20 % or one-fifth of all children ages 3-17 were struggling with some form of learning disability,13 and that those enrolled in Special Ed ranged from 9.2 % in Texas to 19.2 % in New York , or 13.7 % overall.14 Our stingy Congress still chooses not to appropriate funds for programs to mitigate these conditions , and even the CDC seems uninterested in doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our way of life , as indeed they seem to have become .\nBut , even though our government still prefers to ignore them , a mountain of information is available about many factors contributing to this genuine pandemic of modern life , like 1 ) pesticides , herbicides , petrochemicals , endocrine disruptors , and other toxins that pollute our air , water , soil , and food ; 2 ) electromagnetic emissions and ionizing radiations from our machines and 3 ) the pathophysiology of our fast-paced and stressful way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mortality of poverty , war , racism , oppression , incarceration , all of which are likewise more prevalent in the United States than in any other wealthy , industrialized country .\nBut vaccines are largely exempted from even a suspicion of being unsafe , and indeed have been mandated for the entire population , no longer just children , both because and in spite of an act of Congress protecting the industry from any liability for the deaths and serious injuries they cause .\nIn my practice , I regularly witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsened by them ; yet parents and doctors routinely missed the connection .\nThe prevailing wisdom , espoused by the CDC , most scientists and physicians , and humane politicians , is that vaccines are almost ideally safe , and indeed among the greatest healing miracles of all time , such that it is entirely acceptable and even desirable to pile on as many as we wish , and to repeat them as often as we see fit .\nMy own experience with vaccine-injured children .\nI shall now describe my own experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines,15 including the circumstances that conspired to help their parents overlook any link to vaccines at first , and still deceive most pediatricians as well.16 To begin with , physicians are naturally trained to look for the specific effects of each particular drug they give ; so the first cases I was sure of were relatively minor ailments that were traceable to a specific vaccine component because of signs and symptoms that were characteristic of the corresponding disease .\nBut with more and more vaccines being introduced , often several being given at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting 3 components each to begin with , it became increasingly difficult to identify a specific vaccine or component as solely responsible for any specific complication .\nBy the late 1980 's , I began to notice that children recently vaccinated were reacting nonspecifically , by becoming more prone to contracting whatever acute infections were going around their school or neighborhood , or developing a more intense or prolonged version of whatever chronic illnesses they were already bothered by , such as recurrent ear infections , which were practically ubiquitous at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtly to her DPT or polio vaccines , and ran a fever with her first ear infection only after being weaned and entering day care around her first birthday .\nAfter that she seemed fine until her MMR at 15 months , when she came down with 5 ear infections in rapid succession , along with marked intensification of her nasal allergies and eczema , which she had had only mildly since birth .\nHer ear infections cleared up nicely with homeopathic treatment and putting off any further vaccinations , and she remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dead set against resuming her shots .\nStill wedded to the idea of specific reactions , I wondered if ear infections might be a specific effect of the MMR ; but many other cases soon proved otherwise .\nOne 6-year-old girl had had repeated episodes since early infancy , and remained generally `` run down '' in between , needing more sleep , and likely to catch whatever colds and such were going around , which her mother wearily summed up as `` being sick all the time . ''\nShe 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DPT booster before entering First Grade brought on an unusually severe episode , lasting 4 months despite antibiotics , and persuaded her mother to try a different approach .\nShe too recovered nicely with homeopathic treatment , and remained in good health .\nAnother `` aha '' moment arose from a different series of cases , like that of a 15- month-old girl , otherwise in good health , whose ears had n't healed after 11 rounds of antibiotics .\nAfter a healthy pregnancy and easy labor , the mother chose to bottle-feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2 months , with a high fever and violent earache , soon after her first DPT , HiB , and polio combination .\nBut her later episodes were all afebrile , with some fretting and pulling at the ear , and one was totally asymptomatic , with nothing but some fluid behind the eardrum at a routine checkup .\nYet she too seemed vaguely unwell most of the time .\nAdvising her parents to put off any vaccinations for a while , I gave her a constitutional medicine to strengthen her immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sick again , but this time with loud screaming and 103\u00b0 fever , just like her first attack .\nShe recovered from it in less than a day , and never had another episode .\nBy her next visit , 3 months later , she was completely well , and remained so for the 3 years that we kept in touch , with no ear infections , no antibiotics , and , at her parents ' insistence , no shots .\nHer story reminded me that most acute illnesses of childhood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate strong vitality and an immune system that is developing normally , while children who do n't respond acutely and vigorously to infection are often chronically ill and warrant closer attention .\nBut what impressed me most of all was that vaccines had evidently pushed her into chronic territory and kept her there for some time .\nAny vaccine will do .\nAn even more striking finding was that any vaccine might suffice , as with a 10-month-old girl who reacted in exactly the same way to two different vaccinations .\nAgain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her episodes always involved a high fever , intense earache , and loud screaming ; she 'd already undergone 5 of them since 2 months of age , each new one beginning soon after finishing the antibiotic from the one before .\nFussy and irritable as a newborn when her mother weaned her and went back to work , she developed a rash from her milk-based formula ; and everything flared up strongly after her first DPT , HiB , and polio combination , culminating in her first ear infection two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got only the DT , and did n't react to it overtly at all ; but her ear infections continued unabated .\nWhen her mother stopped vaccines and antibiotics and began homeopathic treatment , they quickly subsided , and she remained healthy and symptom-free .\nBut 6 months later her parents separated , and her father took her for her MMR , which promptly brought on 3 typical episodes and 3 rounds of antibiotics .\nOnce again , she recovered quickly at her mother 's , and remained generally healthy through high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she visited her dad , who indulged her with dairy products and took her to the doctor for her full quota of vaccines and antibiotics .\nIn short , she reacted more or less identically , in a pattern distinctively her own , to every vaccine she was given , a pattern which did n't implicate any particular vaccine , but rather some as yet unidentified feature of the vaccination process itself .\nAs the years went by , a lot more cases with a wide variety of complaints reacted to their vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any suggestion that such nonspecific reactions to the vaccination process might simply be aberrations or idiosyncrasies of rare , hypersensitive individuals .\nQuite the contrary : it gradually became clear that children who got well for a period of time from asthma , eczema , ear infections , allergies , ADHD , autism , or just about any other chronic complaint would consistently relapse within a few weeks of their next shots .\nA few cases will suffice to establish the pattern , no matter which vaccines were involved , or what types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were afflicted with them .\nThe clearest example and the easiest to understand was an 18-year-old girl who had been my patient since early childhood and was about to leave for college .\nPlagued with bedwetting and obsessive-compulsive behavior in elementary school , she had successfully overcome both complaints with homeopathic treatment and remained in excellent health , largely symptom-free , for more than 10 years .\nBut her top college required an MMR booster for admission , and within a week of receiving it her old pattern of bedwetting and OCD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full force .\nFortunately , she recovered quickly with the help of the same medicine as in the past , and stayed healthy thereafter .\nThe other adverse reactions that I witnessed ran the gamut of typical pediatric complaints , and were similarly characteristic of the patient rather than of any particular vaccine .\nOne boy of 15 months was brought in for croup , recurrent colds , and developmental issues .\nBorn to a diabetic mother , he weighed 8 pounds at birth , and spent weeks on a respirator in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '' with cyanosis and unstable blood sugars .\nAt home , he was colicky and prone to severe diarrhea , but recovered when his mother eliminated wheat from her diet .\nAt 3 months , a week or so after his first DPT , HiB , and oral polio combination , he became restless , with swollen glands and a sickly pallor that lasted for months , and culminated in an attack of croup , with high fever and a swollen chest , that her pediatrician treated aggressively with hospitalization and IV corticosteroids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of shots for as many months as she dared , but the same croupy illness reappeared within days after she finally agreed to it , with swollen glands and exactly the same symptoms as before .\nWhen I first saw him , the boy appeared subnormal , drooling profusely , with his mouth hanging open , and hiding behind his mother .\nMy first two medicines had no effect at all , but after a third one the whole illness cleared up in a few days , as if by magic ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month later , his mother was ecstatic , with no croup and no swollen glands in the dead of winter .\nI never saw him again , but the mother called years later to report that he was `` thriving and developing normally , like other children his age ! ''\nAsthmatic since 2 years of age and testing positive for a broad range of allergens , another boy of 4 was brought in because bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids had n't prevented major flare-ups the previous fall and winter , some requiring oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeopathic treatment , he cut his inhaled steroids in half , maintained higher peak flows of 150 or more , and recovered from a cold without asthma or drugs for the first time in his life .\nThe next spring and summer , at the height of his allergy season , he was still doing well on half-doses of inhaler , and remained healthy and energetic , with peak flows at record levels of 160-175 .\nBefore entering kindergarten in the fall , his DPT booster brought back his bronchitis almost immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever .\nAgain he responded beautifully to the same medicine as before , stopping all drugs and vaccines , and did well without them for the years we stayed in contact .\nIn the hundreds of similar cases that I cared for , the diversity of their complaints and the similarity of their reactions to vaccination taught me several overlapping reasons why their linkage is so readily overlooked : 1 ) some do n't become diagnosable until more than two weeks after the shots , an interval beyond the official limit set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they typically aggravate or reactivate chronic diseases that have already been diagnosed , and are characteristic of the child , rather than any particular vaccine ; 3 ) they indicate a nonspecific reaction to the vaccination process itself , which few parents or doctors think of or know how to look for ; 4 ) they involve the same illnesses that their unvaccinated companions are also coming down with , encompassing the whole range of pediatric practice ; and 5 ) drugs , herbicides , pesticides , industrial wastes , toxins , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vaccines are not the only causal factor .\nBut the most important reason of all is that chronic diseases naturally tend to drag on , waxing and waning idiosyncratically , without any preformed schedule .\nWith so many different vaccines being given to infants and small children and so little time in between them , it is usually difficult for parents to make the connection unless the child recovers and remains essentially well for several months , only to relapse in identical fashion soon after the next shots are given .\nMerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely meets that standard .\nWith chronic diseases , achieving a level of healing that surpasses their natural ups and downs generally requires withholding all vaccines and antibiotics , stopping or drastically curtailing suppressive drugs , and treating with natural methods like herbs or homeopathic medicines or acupuncture .\nThen the dramatic flare-up following the next vaccination leaves parents and doctors in no doubt of its causative r\u00f4le .\nVaccines and chronic disease in the literature .\nThe cumulative weight of all these cases admitted of no other conclusion than that all vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also pose a major threat of chronic disease that is seldom acknowledged , and that giving them routinely and repeatedly to whole populations of healthy people has contributed substantially to the huge burden of chronic diseases that we collectively bear , not as rare aberrations or side effects , but quite the opposite , as something built into their design .\nWith that realization in mind , I began combing through the scientific literature , and was surprised to discover a substantial body of reputable , published research along much the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously , and directly contradicting what most practicing physicians are authoritatively taught , fondly believe , and seldom think or dare to challenge .\nIn 2011 , two investigators showed convincingly that the Infant Mortality Rates in 33 developed countries were directly proportional to their total vaccine load administered to infants in the first year of life , ranging from an average of 3.36 per 1000 live births in Japan and the Scandinavian countries , which gave 12-14 doses of individual vaccine components , to 5.19 per 1000 , over 50 % higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands , and the US , which gave 24-26 doses.17 The figures were most dramatic for the United States , with by far the highest IMR of 6.2 , well over double that of Japan and Sweden with 2.8 at the low end,18 amply confirming the general consensus of epidemiologists that the US is by far the unhealthiest of industrialized countries in that fundamental respect .\nThe same authors demonstrated a similar effect on mortality and the rate of hospitalization from giving multiple vaccines and vaccine components simultaneously at the same visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39,000 adverse reactions reported to the VAERS system between 1990 and 2010 , and counting the individual components of the MMR and DTaP as 3 separate doses each .\nThey found that infants receiving 6 , 7 , or 8 doses simultaneously were much more likely to be hospitalized afterwards than those receiving 2 , 3 , or 4 , and that those receiving 5-8 doses were also more likely to die afterwards than those receiving 1-4.19 In 2013 , another team analyzed nearly 325,000 American children under 2 years of age who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing those receiving all vaccines recommended on the official CDC schedule with those who received a smaller number , and likewise found that the `` under-vaccinated '' kids were significantly less likely to require outpatient visits , ER visits , and hospitalizations than those who were up-to-date.20 To be sure , epidemiological studies seldom provide conclusive proof ; but the three just cited do present mutually-reinforcing evidence of a linear or proportional relationship between infant morbidity and mortality and the total number of vaccines given , both when given together at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy and early childhood .\nJust as with my clinical cases , these findings clearly and unmistakably implicated the vaccination process per se more than any particular vaccine , and incidentally corroborated the instinctive fear of many parents that the total number of vaccines given does matter , and that far too many are being given .\nWhere are the unvaccinated ?\nOn the other hand , even the Japanese and Swedish infants and the `` under-vaccinated '' group still receive a sizable number of vaccines .\nIt is glaringly obvious that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vaccination on large populations would be to compare two demographically-matched groups of children , one fully vaccinated according to the CDC schedule and the other not vaccinated at all .\nIt truly boggles the mind that our country , which yields to none in its professed commitment to science , has never undertaken such a simple and practical survey , or even proposed it as a good idea .\nThe predictable if not intended result has been to stigmatize the large numbers of unvaccinated children who could provide the ideal control group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude and admiration , rather than the bullying and opprobrium that they typically receive .\nA number of other researchers provided equally suggestive findings regarding specific chronic diseases that have become increasingly prevalent .\nOne 2005 study of over a thousand children in New Zealand showed that 23 % of those vaccinated with DTP and polio developed asthma before the age of 10 , and 30 % saw specialists for various types of allergies , while none of the unvaccinated did so , with similar discrepancies noted in 5- and 16-year-olds as well.21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed significantly higher risks of developing epilepsy,22 type 1 diabetes,23 and the hemorrhagic disease ITP24 in those vaccinated , while three studies of premature newborns in the NICU showed alarmingly higher levels of C-reactive protein , a warning sign of autoimmune phenomena , in those receiving several vaccines simultaneously than in those receiving only one , and a much higher incidence of cyanosis and other life-threatening complications as well.25,26,27 The link between vaccines and chronic disease is similarly highlighted by numerous studies of the converse phenomenon , showing that children who come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , febrile infections of childhood , like measles , mumps , chickenpox , and influenza , are much less likely to develop chronic autoimmune diseases and cancer later in life than those merely vaccinated against them .\nOne study comparing 379 patients with many different types of cancer to the same number of matched controls found that adults with a history of having acquired measles , mumps , rubella , chicken pox , pertussis , or scarlet fever were 20 % less likely to develop genital , prostate , GI , skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of these infections , 60 % less likely if 3 or 4 of them , and 76 % less likely if more than 4.28 The More , the Merrier .\nAs we 've seen , the clinical and experimental evidence cited above explains why the links between vaccines and chronic disease are so easily and indeed routinely missed by doctors and parents alike , an omission that gives credence to the CDC 's repeated insistence that vaccines are safe and effective across the board , so that it 's entirely OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as we like , and to repeat them as often as we think fit .\nBut it also proves that vaccines regularly promote chronic diseases as a built-in feature of their design , a risk directly proportional to the number of vaccines given , both simultaneously at the same visit , and cumulatively over the patient 's lifetime .\nFor children and adolescents , the ACIP 's recommended vaccine schedule for 2016 stipulates a total load of 70 separate doses of individual vaccine components by the time they enter college,29 while for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable figure is 79 more,30 for a grand total of 149 doses , which does n't even include the extra doses for seniors over 65 , pregnant women , their fetuses yet unborn , and other special indications .\nIn short , it is difficult to escape the conclusion that all those adhering faithfully to the CDC schedule , or even some watered-down version of it , are practically guaranteed to develop at least one and quite possibly more major chronic diseases to endure and suffer with throughout life , if not eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same reasoning also gives the lie to the CDC 's standard argument that vaccines are wonderfully cost-effective when compared to the medical and social costs of treating the corresponding diseases.31 This claim dates from the advent of cost-benefit analysis in the Clinton years , when the chickenpox and rotavirus vaccines were introduced for illnesses that are rarely serious in the developed world and are advocated primarily to save the social costs of parents missing work and having to stay home and care for their sick children.32 As applied to all vaccine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the monumental expense of caring for 1 ) the large number of patients killed or disabled by brain damage , including autism , ADHD , GBS , MS , seizures , learning disabilities , etc.\n, and by other serious autoimmune diseases that have been shown to be vaccine-related but not yet acknowledged as such ; 2 ) the even larger volume of patients with common diseases that are similarly activated or made worse by vaccines , like all the cases of asthma , allergies , ear infections , eczema , etc.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ common enough to be the rule , not the exception ; and 3 ) the cumulative effect of the total vaccine load , the piling on of more and more vaccines without regulation or restraint , with every child being required to receive them , and the entire adult population now next in line .\nAlthough the extent of this burden has never been seriously investigated or even acknowledged , it 's already clear that these tidy official estimates of the social and medical costs of vaccinating represent just a tiny fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical , our ever more ambitious goal of vaccinating everybody against every disease we can think of has become one of the most reckless and wildly expensive medical experiments ever undertaken , and goes a long way toward explaining why our badly misnamed `` health-care '' system devours such an inordinate share of our GDP , and why we who live here are nevertheless so riddled with chronic disease and score so poorly on infant mortality and other standard measures of general health .\nSome thoughts on the chronic state .\nOn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and unique benefit , one far more valuable than the partial , temporary , and counterfeit immunity that they provide .\nTo begin with , the industry knows precisely how to make them , and how they succeed in eliciting an antibody response .\nIf achieving that result does in fact proceed by way of or at least consistently results in the development of chronic diseases , as appears to be the case , it follows that vaccines offer a promising vantage point for exploring and hopefully solving the riddle we began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chronic state , of how our illnesses become chronic and thus so much more difficult to heal .\nIf that much is true , then chronicity needs to be reframed as a disturbance of the immune mechanism that we 've already alluded to , the formative experience of coming down with and recovering from the acute infectious diseases that we vaccinate against , because that process requires an impressive army of immune functions working in concert that vaccination is meant to replace , and are thus much too easily lost sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles , for example , is precisely the collaborative effort of the immune system to expel the virus from the blood , an all-important task requiring a formidable array of mechanisms acting in unison , and unattainable by any one or part of them acting apart from the others .\nIt begins with inflammatory sensitization of the mucous membranes of the nasopharynx , the first tissues to receive the virus , and hence those best-equipped to get rid of it , by sneezing and coughing.33 Next comes the activation and signaling of monocytes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police the blood and connective tissues in order to detect , engulf , and digest invading viruses.34 That process is further assisted by serum complement , proteins that attach to and fragment them,35 and by cytokines , peptides and smaller proteins like interferons and interleukins , which help the phagocytes signal , communicate with , and direct one another to where they are needed.36 Collectively , these mechanisms comprise the most basic or `` cellular '' level of immunity , our first line of defense against foreign invaders , which initiates , co-ordinates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole .\nThen , more or less concurrently , cloned subsets of lymphocytes and plasma cells from the thymus and bone marrow synthesize several types of specific antibodies directed against the virus , which promote clumping , render it insoluble , and assist the phagocytes in ingesting it.37 These constitute the `` humoral '' aspect of immunity , which leaves a permanent memory of the virus encrypted within the genetic material of these immunocompetent cells , to help them respond to it even more promptly and efficiently should they encounter it again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-lasting immunity conferred by expelling the virus is profoundly health-giving in two fundamental ways .\nFirst , it is specific , in the obvious sense that virtually everyone who recovers from the measles will never again be susceptible to it , no matter how many times they are re-exposed to the virus , or how virulent the particular epidemic may be.39 Less often appreciated or talked about but at least as important is the nonspecific immunity that results from having activated and co-ordinated this whole parade of mechanisms , which then primes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously , and in concert to whatever other infections it may encounter in the future .\nAs we saw , hidden somewhere within that generic memory lies the so far unexplained miracle of protecting us against developing chronic , autoimmune diseases and cancer later in life.40 When discussing vaccines , it is important to remember that whatever good they accomplish does n't provide anything even remotely like these precious gifts .\nWhen a vaccine is injected or ingested , there may be a brief inflammatory reaction at the site , but no local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lymphocytes , no acute illness , and thus , above all , no clear mechanism or pathway for getting rid of it .\nAfter a few weeks , yes , there will be measurable titers of specific antibodies ; and yes , the recipients will probably be somewhat less likely to come down with the corresponding acute disease in the near future than they were before .\nBut without the acute illness , there is no priming of their immune mechanism as a whole , no significant improvement in the general health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus no encrypted memory of the infection .\nThe purpose of vaccination is rather to prevent an infection that has n't yet manifested from doing so in the future ; so , without the memory , it would seem that the vaccine , or at least the instructions that it contains , must instead remain as a physical presence inside the body , to continue stimulating antibody production for long periods of time .\nEither way , the bottom line is that vaccination is by definition a chronic phenomenon .\nIt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth to claim that a vaccine renders us immune to or protects us against an infection if in fact it only drives the infectious agent deeper into the body , causing our vital organs to harbor it chronically , and thus presumably reprograms our immunocompetent cells to be less capable of responding to it acutely , and perhaps to other foreign antigens as well , such that our cellular immune responses are generally weaker , more chronic , and less capable of carrying out their healing work .\nIn either case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer ; but they 're not telling , and the CDC and FDA seem quite content to keep it a secret , even though it could help solve the enduring riddle of chronic disease , and in any case is far too important to be allowed to remain anyone 's private property .\nI 'm a clinician , not a research scientist ; but here are some general reflections on the subject that have occurred to me based of my own limited knowledge .\nFirst , I would divide vaccines into three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as MMR , chickenpox , Sabin 's oral polio ( OPV ) , rotavirus , and some flu vaccines , which are attenuated versions of the corresponding pathogens ; 2 ) killed or denatured viruses , bacteria , and antigenic fragments derived from them , like tetanus toxoid , diphtheria toxoid , cellular and acellular pertussis , HiB , pneumococcus , and most flu vaccines ; and from them , like hepatitis B , HPV , and the various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines .\nWe already know that chickenpox , herpes simplex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their genetic material into the DNA of their host cells and reproducing along with them , yet remaining latent as `` episomes , '' 41 and precipitating overt disease only years or decades later , if at all .\nIf the live-virus vaccines have a similar capability , the host cells harboring them would similarly undergo some genetic modification , perhaps mild enough to remain subclinical at first , with few or no symptoms for a long time , but eventually perhaps to the degree of becoming recognizable as `` foreign '' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninfected neighbors .\nSuch carrier states would seem to provide a perfect recipe for chronic , autoimmune phenomena of every degree , from subclinical to life-threatening .\nThe toxoids and other `` non-living '' vaccines are more complicated , being only weak antigens on their own , and requiring the addition of chemical `` adjuvants '' to generate a robust antibody response .\nThe commonest and most important adjuvants are the hydroxide and other water-soluble salts of aluminum , which have already been found to be powerfully neurotoxic all by themselves,42 and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too high for the kidneys to be capable of excreting them ; 43 so these too would appear to have achieved some sort of permanent residency .\nThe bioengineered vaccines also make use of adjuvants , and are said to be non-living and thus incapable of initiating an infectious illness ; but I 've classified them separately , because `` viruses '' are simply strands of DNA or RNA embedded in a protein coat , and these vaccines , although modified from their live originals , still have both .\nSo declaring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy statement based on wishful thinking , in lieu of knowing or maybe even wanting to know whether or not they 're `` alive , '' or not , or , in other words , what illnesses they might or might not be capable of .\nA few other vaccine ingredients are known to be unhealthy , or look as if they might be , and have been added without providing any compelling reasons for doing so , and therefore warrant more thorough investigation for possible chronic toxicity of their own : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an organomercury germicide that is associated with neuropathology like that of the aluminum salts,43 and formaldehyde , a 2 ) polysorbate 80 , an emulsifying agent , used in the treatment of brain tumors , to help various chemotherapeutic drugs cross the blood-brain barrier,45 a property which naturally raises the fear that it could be helping vaccines do the same , if not intentionally used for that purpose ; and 3 ) foreign human and animal cells , genetic material , and proteins , all of which seem quite capable of instigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the likelihood that all vaccines are capable of initiating and exacerbating chronic diseases , there is ample , clear scientific evidence that they also regularly initiate a variety of autoimmune responses , whether subclinical or overt , according to the makeup of each recipient , and that these capabilities are likewise built into their design , so that every dose may well have some such effect on every recipient .\nProf. Yehuda Shoenfeld , a leading authority on autoimmune phenomena , asserts that subclinical responses are the usual or baseline effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which case the overt disease sometimes may require a further such stimulus to precipitate it : In 1982 , epidemiological , clinical , and animal research showed that demyelinating autoimmune neuropathies such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and MS could occur up to 18 month following vaccination .\nThe disease would first manifest with vague symptoms like myalgias , paresthesias , and weakness , which were deemed insignificant and ignored by the treating physicians .\nThese would progress slowly and insidiously until the patient was exposed to a secondary immune stimulus , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger the acute disease .\nIt was the secondary response that would bring about the overt manifestation of an already present but subclinical , long-term , persistent disease .\nThe typical vaccine contains all the necessary biochemical components to induce autoimmune manifestations [ that are ] serious , disabling , and even fatal in certain individuals .\n[ Since ] they are administered to previously healthy people , efforts should be made to identify those more at risk .\nThe necessity of multiple doses should also be considered , as [ it ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning has led to the discovery of autoimmunity as a probable causative mechanism for more and more chronic diseases , both old and new , with autoimmune phenomena turning up just about whenever and wherever anyone takes the trouble to look for them , as if they were coextensive if not synonymous with chronicity itself .\nThe following is a composite list of chronic autoimmune diseases that I put together from those cited in the PDR and the literature as adverse reactions to just the MMR,48 Hep B,49 HPV,50 influenza,51 and pneumococcal vaccines.52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various chronic diseases diagnosed in clinical practice , but not those linked to other vaccines , and those for which no autoantibodies have as yet been found or looked for : It remains to be determined if autoimmunity is the fundamental mechanism behind all cases of chronic disease initiated or exacerbated by vaccines , or only some of them , and if there are cases and varieties of chronic disease that are neither autoimmune nor adversely affected by vaccines at all .\nBut as the list keeps growing , it is already clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in producing and aggravating them , and that these remaining questions could all be answered without serious difficulty if we simply bothered to look .\nAlong these same lines , it would be extremely interesting , highly worthwhile , and logistically simple to test everyone , both vaccinated and not , for the presence of autoimmune markers in the blood .\nAs soon as this idea first came to me some years ago , I learned that just such a study had already been conducted by a group of veterinarians at Purdue University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very small scale .\nThe authors divided 10 purebred beagle puppies into two groups of 5 , one vaccinated on the usual schedule , and the other not vaccinated at all , and followed them closely for 3 years with blood tests and immunoassays .\nThey found that all of the vaccinated puppies tested positive , showing significant titers of autoantibodies directed against important tissue proteins , chiefly 1 ) fibronectin , antibodies against which are implicated in the pathogenesis of scleroderma , rheumatoid arthritis , and systemic lupus in dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies against which are found in rheumatoid arthritis , systemic 3 ) cardiolipin , antibodies against which have similarly been implicated in cardio-myopathy ; and while none in the unvaccinated group did so,53 a discrepancy which led them to comment as follows : These proteins are typically of bovine origin , since fetal calf serum is used to grow the viruses for vaccine production .\nTheir close similarity to dog proteins results in a situation where antibodies produced by [ the ] vaccinated dogs may cross-react with dog proteins in a process similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccinated dogs developed any overt chronic disease throughout the observation period ; 55 but unfortunately the authors ' request to extend the study for a longer period was denied , and their funding was abruptly terminated .\nFor all of the reasons discussed above , the relative invisibility of vaccinations as a cause of chronic disease means that we 've been measuring the wrong thing .\nAt present , the CDC simply accepts the data from vaccine safety trials that are financed , conducted , and micromanaged by the manufacturers themselves , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Professor of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School , who was fired as Editor-in-Chief of the New England Journal of Medicine for her many writings that were highly critical of the drug industry : It is no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published .\nThe boundaries between academic medicine and the pharmaceutical industry have been dissolving since the 1980 's , and the major differences between their missions are becoming blurred .\nMost clinical trials are conducted by the industry .\nThey contract with academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers are little more than hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to instructions from their corporate paymasters .\nTheir sponsors keep the data , analyze it , write the papers , and decide whether , when , or where to submit them for publication .\nIn multi-center trials [ the researchers ] may not even be allowed to see the data .\n[ They ] also have other financial ties to the companies that sponsor their work .\nThey serve as consultants to the companies whose products they evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaus , enter into royalty arrangements , agree to be listed authors of ghost-written articles , promote drugs and devices at company symposia , and allow themselves to be plied with expensive gifts and luxurious trips.56 A pithier , more succinct version was provided by Dr. Peter Rost , a former VP of Pfizer , in an expos\u00e9 about the HPV vaccine , which featured him practically boasting of his aggressive marketing tactics for promoting the company 's products , in flagrant violation of the ethical guidelines that Pfizer still subscribes to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , as indeed they still remain : Universities and health organizations [ are ] out there begging for money .\nNobody has any money .\nThe only ones who do are the big international corporations , and they have lots of money .\nThey give grants for research , pay doctors and researchers thousands of dollars to travel around , speak at conferences , and establish educational programs , all to make profits for their products .\n[ The safety trials ] are supposedly third-party and independent , but the money wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug , unless they say what you want them to say .\nEverybody know this is how things work .\nThe drug companies know it , and you know it .\nOnly the public does n't know it.57 A closer look at these safety trials reveals four areas of glaring scientific misconduct by the industry : 1 ) As a matter of policy , they prefer not to use unvaccinated control groups for comparison,58 so that it becomes impossible to establish a strict causal relationship between the vaccine and [ any ] adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called `` control '' groups receive either the chemical adjuvant alone , with its own documented toxicity , or another vaccine entirely , typically one produced by a competitor , or discontinued because of its known adverse 2 ) To be considered vaccine-related , most adverse reactions must happen within 14 days of the shot , thus ruling out the entire chronic dimension where most 3 ) Many trials involve several doses administered months apart , with the period of active supervision limited to 14 days or less , and a vanishingly small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specifically asked about , with other unsolicited complaints volunteered by the subject apt to be disqualified.61 4 ) The lead investigator is given absolute authority to decide whether any adverse reaction is or is not vaccine-related , based on criteria that are never specified.62 Obviously , to provide a truer picture of how vaccines initiate chronic diseases or make them worse , safety trials will need to be redesigned , conducted , and supervised by an agency that is truly independent of the industry .\nThey could be retrospective at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and adults who have already refused their shots .\nWith so many different vaccines to consider , and several containing multiple components , they should include those fully vaccinated according to current guidelines , those partially vaccinated according to their choice , and those who are not vaccinated at all .\nBut even for prospective trials , blinding is both unnecessary and undesirable ; everyone should receive precisely the level of vaccination and non-vaccination that they choose .\nSecondly , the definition of adverse reactions , injuries , and illnesses from vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subclinical autoimmune phenomena as well as the initiation , re-activation , and intensification of pre-existing complaints .\nThe trial period should be lengthened to several years at least , with active supervision throughout , and subjects should be encouraged to report every adverse reaction , not merely the few already acknowledged .\nInvestigators should be given clear guidelines about subjects ' reports , not blanket authority to dismiss them as unrelated ; and their supervision should include social psychological , and emotional variables , like absenteeism , school and job performance , relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-being , anxiety , and the like , supplemented when appropriate by reports of relatives , friends , and colleagues , to give a more well-rounded sense of the health and well-being of each subject , and to what extent they were affected by vaccination .\nInvestigators should also be trained clinicians , attentive to each patient and their particular circumstances , and capable of judging whether or not reported complaints are vaccine-related , rather than simply checking off the presence or absence of a few specific diagnoses already agreed upon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic diseases linked to vaccination encompass the entire spectrum of clinical medicine , the metric providing the simplest and clearest overview of the whole subject will necessarily be the All-Cause Morbidity and Mortality , i.e.\n, the total number of deaths , severe diseases , and disabilities from all non-traumatic causes , combined into one over-arching statistic , comparing those receiving varying levels of vaccination , according to their own choice , with those refusing to be vaccinated at all .\nRegardless of outcome , the result of this survey would provide important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morbidity and mortality proves to be lower for the vaccinated than the unvaccinated , or even the same , then people like me will need to stop blaming the vaccines for everything I 've been accusing them of , while if the unvaccinated turn out to be healthier , these agents will end up being reconsidered in a completely different light .\nEither way , we will all have learned something important and valuable about vaccines and the nature of chronic diseases that we are all at risk for .\nThe COVID-19 illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nRight from the beginning , the pandemic virus displayed the very same chronic features of vaccine-related illness that I 've just been describing .\nFirst of all , around 40 % of those testing positive remained completely asymptomatic,63 while the true figures , including those who were not tested , were of course far higher ; and of those who actually became ill , 80 % were only mildly so,64 just as most people vaccinated for any reason experience very few and usually mild symptoms immediately afterward .\nSecondly , the deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderly and chronically ill , especially in nursing homes or extended-care facilities , where the victims had already been suffering with one or more chronic diseases , such that it was often difficult to say whether the actual cause of death was the COVID or the comorbidity,65,66,67 an ambiguity that closely resembled my clinical experience with vaccines , which most commonly was that they simply made worse what was already there .\nThird , even though most acute cases began as a flu-like syndrome , with cough , chest congestion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressed to deoxygenation of the blood and microcoagulation in the pulmonary alveoli , known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome , or ARDS , this complication also tended to develop slowly and insidiously over many days or weeks , during which the patients appeared to be doing well and breathing normally , with no idea of the danger until shortly before they died.68,69 Fourth , many of the most serious cases spared the lungs entirely , or produced microscopic lesions indicating a disturbance of the clotting mechanism in other organs and tissues as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter which organs were involved , autopsies consistently revealed signs of immunological dysregulation known as `` cytokine storm , '' which involved excessively high levels of interleukins in the damaged cells and tissues.71 Finally , in a very substantial number of patients , as many as 20-30 % in some series , chronic symptoms appeared and persisted chronically , for weeks or months afterward , as well as proving refractory to treatment in many cases .\nKnown as the `` long COVID , '' these cases at first seemed like residues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaved more like chronic diseases in their own right , with lesser degrees of the same hyperimmune dysregulation , and even developed in quite a few patients who had seemingly recovered , or been only mildly ill until then.72 In all of these respects , the COVID-19 illness has behaved much like other chronic diseases , with a slow course , acute phases and even flare-ups , and characterized by varying degrees of immune dysregulation in both the fatal cases and those with the `` long-COVID '' version .\nLike any chronic disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fatal termination , or linger indefinitely , and perhaps flare up intermittently in the future , a capability that might cast new light on those cases of presumed reinfection as simply exacerbations of the original in its ongoing , chronic state .\nFurther confirmation of chronicity lies in its other major clustering of severe and fatal cases in our society 's least fortunate , those handicapped by poverty , discrimination , malnutrition , homelessness , and overcrowding , just like the other chronic diseases that plague us all.73 In these respects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. already carries the heaviest burden of chronic disease in the developed world , and that the COVID saves most of its fire for those who are already ill , helps to explain why our deaths from it also outnumber everybody else 's , and why the pandemic will undoubtedly potentiate both trends still further in the future .\nRight from the beginning , important features of the COVID-19 illness set it apart from almost all other viral infections that we know about and vaccinate against .\nFirst , as we saw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infection who were asymptomatic , combined with the undoubtedly far greater percentage who were never even tested , seem unequalled , as do the vast majority of its most severe and fatal cases who were elderly and chronically ill , especially in nursing homes and rehab facilities .\nNaturally , these folks tend to fare worse with the flu and other seasonal infections as well ; but with COVID the statistics were so lopsided that it almost seemed as if the illness were actively seeking them out , which seemed quite new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena of cytokine storm , which had previously been described in fatal cases of SARS and MERS , the first major coronavirus outbreaks we 're aware of , as well as influenza ; 74 but with the COVID they were present in not only the most serious ARDS cases,75 but also to a lesser degree in the chronic `` long COVID , '' 76 which pointed to immune dysregulation as the unique , signature pathology of the illness in all of its forms , just like other chronic diseases .\nAnd finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , which it shares with many types of herpesvirus , notably Epstein-Barr , Cytomegalovirus , Herpes Simplex , and Varicella-Shingles , as well as Hepatitis C. But it is the only known coronavirus with that capability .\nThe official claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the Wuhan live-animal market,77 in the same city as the Chinese government 's virus research laboratory , has fueled much speculation that it was actually bioengineered and subsequently escaped from there , a theory given further credence by much circumstantial evidence , including the NIH 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lab for `` gain-of-function '' research on coronaviruses specifically , soon after Trump took office in 2017,78 which also roughly coincided with none other than Dr. Fauci brokering the deal , not to mention his predicting the massive outbreak of a new disease 3 years before it actually happened.79 But to my mind the most compelling reason for favoring a lab origin is this combination of strikingly improbable if not unprecedented features in the illness that it caused , and is still causing , all of which could conjure up the fiendish possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealth bioweapon for purposes of global depopulation : 1 ) that it outstrips all other viruses we know of in its contagiousnesss , on the one hand , and the percentage of infected people who are asymptomatic or only mildly ill , on the other ; 2 ) that it selectively targets and kills those who are already chronically ill ; 3 ) that it appears to be even more mutable than the influenza viruses , and thus has the power to continually reinvent itself ; 4 ) that it is essentially a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rapid and fatal termination in many patients , a lingering chronic version in others , and even apparent reinfections months or years later that may prove to be recurrences of the original ; and 5 ) that the micropathology of both acute and chronic forms involves varying degrees of immune dysregulation , up to and inclusing cytokine storm , all of which make it appear highly probable 6 ) that it was bioengineered in the Wuhan lab , to a great extent with our help , if not at our behest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally or by just the sort of accident that our scientists have long been worried about ; and 7 ) that the program seems to have succeeded brilliantly in achieving precisely what its paymasters had in mind , whatever that may have been .\nThe lab-origin theory has also received important scientific backing from the Nobelist Luc Montagnier , the discoverer of HIV , the virus linked to AIDS , when he detected significant nucleic acid sequences of that virus in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.80 I leave it to the proper authorities to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental or deliberate , and whether , as American intelligence has since maintained , the outbreak actually began in the summer or fall of 2019,81 such that the CDC and NIH already knew about it months before making it public .\nIn any case , whether or not the SARS-CoV-2 was man-made , whatever we were up to with the Chinese in Wuhan was a disaster waiting to happen , now or in the future , such that President Obama was entirely right to have banned all such `` gain-of-function '' research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of his dismissals , had little choice but to belatedly cancel the NIH 's Wuhan project in the midst of the pandemic.83 Like all vaccines , those directed against the COVID will undoubtedly initiate and worsen whatever chronic diseases are already there , including , and by no means least , the COVID itself .\nSeveral of them also utilize a new mRNA technology that promises cutting-edge benefits and threatens brand-new complications as well .\nShowcasing the gene-splicing technique that won a Nobel Prize for its inventors , these bioengineered mRNA vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to remain physically present as antigen-antibody complexes inside the body for long periods of time .\nIn lieu of the antigen itself , in this case the SARS-CoV-2 virus or its `` spike '' protein , these vaccines deliver a bioengineered strand of genetic instructions to the recipient 's messenger RNA to synthesize the similarly bio-engineered protein .\nThen , after serving that purpose , we 're assured that the resulting mRNA is promptly degraded , leaving nothing behind.84 But if the protection these vaccines provide is meant to be long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccines , then even if the messenger RNA is destroyed , the genetic information it contained will still need to be retained and used in the future , presumably by encryption within the DNA of the cells receiving it , which would then become a permanent part of the genome , despite the manufacturers ' and the CDC 's reassurance that that does n't and indeed ca n't possibly happen.85 On the other hand , if the mRNA is indeed destroyed , then its action will likewise be transitory , as will any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case its power to prevent the infection , which has always been the main reason for vaccinating , will be forfeit .\nThat does indeed appear to be what has happened , with the CDC reluctantly admitting that they do n't prevent infection , and with new boosters being promoted every few months , it seems , as new variants continue to emerge.86,87 Even if this new technology lives up to its billing of custom-designing a new booster for each new variant as it appears,88 it might not be developed and deployed fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own ; and even if it could , giving so many vaccines so often would only emphasize the impermanence of their effect , not to mention their long-term effect in prolonging the outbreak , and weakening our immune status in the process .\nIn any case , a number of researchers have found that the mRNA synthesized in response to these new vaccines is not entirely destroyed , and can indeed be incorporated into cells of the recipient , by means of the process known as `` reverse transcription '' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the host 's genome.89,90 Even before that , scientists from Johns Hopkins and elsewhere showed that the mRNA vaccines do n't prevent transmission of the virus , and are thus not really vaccines at all in that bottom-line sense , as the CDC was finally forced to admit : New data was released by the CDC last week showing that vaccinated people infected with the delta variant carry viral loads similar to those of people who are unvaccinated.91 In short , it is now clear that the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent serious illness and death in those already infected , which the official statistics would appear to confirm that they are doing , at least in the short run.92 A partial explanation of these paradoxes may lie buried somewhere within the novel circumstance that these agents are not being used to prevent an infection from happening in the future , like all other vaccines in the past , but rather on an emergency basis to deal with an actual epidemic , for the very first time in history .\nPrecisely how this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention the long-term health of our country and planet , are still unclear .\nAlmost certainly , like all previous vaccines , they 'll make worse what 's already there , and will do so by means of autoimmune phenomena of every description , encompassing both subclinical and overt chronic diseases , as well as worsening slowly and insidiously over time .\nIn particular , since what 's already there includes the COVID , a chronic disease in its own right , these effects will almost certainly involve immune dysregulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , multi-organ failure , and death in the future , or linger on as `` long COVID , '' or flare up again perhaps , simulating a reinfection in the more distant future .\nIn addition , vaccinating in the midst of the outbreak , even with more traditional vaccines not using the mRNA technology , will almost certainly potentiate the virus ' well-known mutability , and indeed has already accelerated the development of mutant strains and the emergence of clinically significant variants , as Dr. Montagnier has repeatedly and insistently warned.93 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its subtle conditioning of the general population , building on the inevitable fear and uncertainty , to justify mandating and enforcing more and more vaccinations on top of the COVID , including adults as well as children , and thus weakening even further our ability to respond acutely and vigorously to future infections by promoting chronic responses in general , as we saw .\nAnother important reason to avoid the COVID vaccines may be the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein itself , the decisive element in the pathogenesis of the COVID illness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment of , and the mRNA types instruct their recipients how to synthesize .\nProfessor Byram Bridle and his team of Canadian virologists have shown that the spike protein is significantly toxic all by itself , circulates widely through the blood after vaccination , and poses a significant threat of damage to major organs , including the heart , lungs , liver , spleen , bone marrow , adrenals , and ovaries,94 even if it does n't manifest clinically until much later .\nFinally , in addition to weakening our natural immunity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic misunderstanding that is fraught with perils of its own .\nAs we wait for them to ward off diseases we might not get , most of which probably would n't hurt us if we did , we measure their effectiveness by the high titers of specific antibodies they provide , and infer from it our level of immunity as well .\nThe antibody level thus becomes a substitute for our natural response to infection , but the latter , as we saw , is a massive , co-ordinated , acute process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing touch.95 Once we recover from the illness , they 're no longer needed , because the memory of the infection is encrypted within the B and T cells.96 In other words , once again , we 're measuring the wrong thing : the immune process is directed by these cells , which then preserve the immunity we 've earned in ways that we do n't yet know or even seem to care how to measure .\nAs far back as 1980 , Dr. James Cherry , a leading vaccine advocate , showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measles whose antibody levels had fallen below supposedly immune levels responded only minimally and for an unacceptably short time to a booster shot.97 Taking this discovery a step further was a memorable case from my own practice , a healthy 31-yer-old lab tech who reacted badly to her first round of 3 Hep B shots as required for her training , but eventually recovered .\n4 years later , her new employer retested her and found zero antibodies , which led him to infer that she was still susceptible and insisted that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of chronic complaints , chiefly autoimmune thyroiditis , for which she sought compensation under the Federal VICP program , and hired me to write a report in support of it.98 Her claim was dismissed without even a hearing , since thyroiditis was and still is not listed as an official complication of the Hep B vaccine .\nI cite her case and Dr. Cherry 's finding to take issue with the largely unchallenged assumption that immunity is a purely quantitative variable , that the specific antibody titer accurately measures it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force can ratchet it up to the desired level more or less at will .\nThe COVID illness demonstrates the same unwisdom even more dramatically , since the cytokine storm of the worst cases are characterized by excessively and indeed dangerously high levels of antibody .\nSimilar reactions were observed in animal trials of vaccines against the SARS and other early coronaviruses,99 and more recently during a vaccination campaign against dengue fever in the Philippines.100 In both these earlier cases , the subjects developed what were welcomed as splendidly high levels of antibody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to suffer and not seldom die from cytokine storm , also known as antibody-dependent enhancement , or ADE , when they contacted the virus some time later .\nThese dramatic overreactions not only led to the discontinuation of these vaccines , but alarmed even notorious pro-vaccine advocates like Paul Offit to plead for caution when the first COVID vaccines were fast-tracked using the same technology.101 Indeed , the immune dysregulation involved in ADE and cytokine storm may be an extreme form of the immune dysregulation produced routinely by the vaccination process itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which substitutes hyperactivity of the humoral system for the concerted action of the immune mechanism as a whole , as mobilized by an actual infection , regulated by the cellular system , and preserved as an enduring memory for the future .\nThe warning of Lucija Tomljenovic and Richard Shaw , two Professors at the University of British Columbia , might well stand for the concerns of a growing number of scientists who question the unlimited vaccination agenda that now prevails : Persistence of helper T-cells that stimulate antibody production , due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have profound , long-term , adverse effects on the developing immune system in children .\nA newborn infant has an undeveloped immune system which is limited in function and requires a series of challenges to bring it to full capacity .\nPrior to vaccines , these were relatively minor childhood diseases , such as mumps and measles .\nVaccines stimulating antibody production by the humoral immune system , located in the bone marrow , bypass the cellular immune system on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and digestive tracts , leaving the latter unchallenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The end result of [ this ] prolonged shift may be permanently stunted cellular immunity , which is far more efficient than the humoral system in clearing viral pathogens.102 For the clinician , `` following the science '' proves its value in and through our special vantage point of private encounters with individual patients and the collaborative , personal relationships that develop from them , which can unlock secrets that prove impenetrable otherwise .\nBut although their purview includes the scientific realm of causes , mechanisms , diseases , and abnormalities , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete realm of the here-and-now , the unique , lived experience of individual human beings .\nWhen parents told me that their kids were injured or made sick by vaccines , it was obviously an important part of my job to determine as best I could whether and to what extent those judgments were accurate ; and certainly there were times when I had good reason to suspect that they were n't .\nBut the kind of relationship that makes practices work involves trusting what our patients tell us to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , whether rightly or wrongly , until something happens to convince us otherwise , which happened very rarely in my experience .\nThe manufacturers , the CDC , and the medical profession have convinced most of us that vaccines are uniformly safe and miraculously effective , so that it is entirely acceptable and even desirable to pile on as many as we like and to repeat them as often as we see fit.103 But my long experience of caring for vaccine-injured children leads to a very different conclusion ; and the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by appealing to my readers to hear the voices of those thousands upon thousands of parents who have personally witnessed the deaths and crippling illnesses of their children as the result of them , and must live every day amid the wreckage of their shattered lives , sufficient to break any heart , that cries out at the very least for caution , restraint , and simple compassion for the viewpoint of those whose lived experience , whatever may have caused it , is so tragically different from that of everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow unmoved by their loss .\nI 'll put it another way : if vaccines were truly as safe and effective as the CDC and the drug industry are telling us , then the vast majority of these parents would have to be either lying , ignorant , deluded , or stupid , just like those `` anti-vaxxers '' demonized in the media , clinging to a wildly-flawed , anti-scientific ideology .\nHaving cared for many , many such children , I can say with complete assurance that their parents are none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tragedies , who must now bear the burden of that grief and the expense of caring for their loved ones for the rest of their lives .\n`` Ex-vaxxers '' would be a more accurate term , since their only mistake was to have done exactly what they were told ; they are asking for nothing more than a public acknowledgment of their plight , although they surely deserve a great deal more than that .\nRequiring no advanced degree , simple common sense is ideally equipped to understand that caring parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own kids than those who make , sell , and profit obscenely from these products , yet ca n't be sued for the deaths and crippling injuries they cause .\nConsider this tale of a 12-year-old boy who lived over a thousand miles away , never became my patient , and came to my attention solely through his mother 's letter ; but her words were so heartfelt and so congruent with the rest of my experience that I ca n't imagine them to be anything but the honest truth of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect encapsulation of the cognitive dissonance that I 've just described and am still caught up in : My son Adam was healthy until his first MMR at 15 months .\nWithin 2 weeks he had flu and cold symptoms , which persisted for 6 weeks , at which point his eyes became puffy , he was hospitalized with nephrotic syndrome , and a renal biopsy showed \u201c focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis.\n\u201d When it didn \u2019 t respond to steroids , I asked if it could be related to the vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t , and we accepted that .\nOver the next 4 years he was hospitalized repeatedly , and missed many months of school , but finally went into total remission , seeming normal and healthy and staying off all medications for about 5 years .\nWhen he turned 10 , his pediatrician recommended a booster , saying that a rise in measles cases made it dangerous for him not to be protected .\nChecking the PDR and other sources , I found no contraindication for kidney disease and no listing of it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to the shot .\nIn less than 2 weeks he relapsed , with 4+ protein in his urine , swelling , and weight gain , signs that we recognized immediately .\nHe got worse even on Prednisone , and was admitted in hypertensive crisis , with blood in his urine , fluid in his lungs , and massive edema .\nOn Cytoxan , high doses of Prednisone , and three other drugs , he slowly improved , but missed another 7 months of school .\nIt \u2019 s been 2 years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs Captopril daily for high blood pressure and spills 4+ protein every day .\nThe doctor says that he sustained major kidney damage , will always need medication to control his blood pressure , and will worsen as he grows older , necessitating a transplant eventually .\nThis time I was sure that his condition was related to the vaccine , but still the doctors didn \u2019 t take me seriously , and told me it was a coincidence .\nI began searching for information , and even contacted the manufacturer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost identical case reports of nephrotic syndrome following the MMR vaccine .\nIt \u2019 s difficult for laypeople to get information or even ask questions , since we don \u2019 t use correct medical terms and are made to feel stupid .\nPlease tell me if my ideas are reasonable .\nI don \u2019 t think my son could tolerate another episode , and I think he \u2019 d have normal blood pressure and kidney function today if not for that second vaccination .\nI also have a great concern for other children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving the MMR and whose doctors never make the connection .\nThey could all be at great risk if revaccinated .\nI realize that this letter has taken up a great deal of your time , and I \u2019 d appreciate any help you can give me .\nIf we were closer , I \u2019 d make an appointment to see you in person , so please feel free to charge me .\nThank you.104 This woman honestly believed that the MMR vaccine had crippled her son for life , yet had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it , the doctor who prescribed it , or the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program , as she was certainly entitled to do , a lack of ulterior motive that only lends further credence to her story .\nShe wrote to me simply to find a physician to hear and validate the truth of her experience , which neither the pediatrician who gave the shots , the specialists who treated Adam in the hospital , nor the other doctors she consulted were willing to do .\nThe events she had witnessed first-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to endure the consequences of ever since indicated a causal link that would be sufficiently obvious to be grasped at once by any reasonably attentive eighth-grader of average intelligence .\nYet every one of the boy 's physicians dismissed his misfortune as a coincidence .\nEven today , thirty years later , renal failure has still not been recognized as an adverse effect of the MMR vaccine , an omission that would have assured his mother 's defeat in court had she chosen that route .\nThis glaring discrepancy between the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his doctors and the vaccine manufacturers all escaped having to take any responsibility for it will serve to introduce the profound mystery that led her to write to me and has never ceased to trouble and indeed infuriate me , both before and since .\n\u2022 `` COPD : Facts , Statistics , and You , ''

Vaccines", "content": "This is a follow on to a UK Column Report last week with excellent analysis by retired nurse Debi Evans and News anchor Brian Gerrish which focused on the board meeting of the MHRA of Tuesday June 21 .\nThere were many disturbing features in the report which runs from 1.06.50 on the link , but one really surprising fact which emerged - and I have been following the MHRA closely since at least 2004 - is that they combine purported role as a regulator of the biologics industry with developing its own biological products and trading with the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 the National Institute of Biological Standards and Control ( NIBSC ) though it \u2019 s not immediately clear how long NIBSC has traded its own biological products .\nOf particular relevance is that coincidentally with this meeting a new polio scare was being launched in the UK - no one as of this present time has been diagnosed with polio but polio has been detected in a North East London sewer .\nIt is therefore fascinating to follow the conversation ( which I have transcribed as best I can ) between to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey , and Stephen Lightfoot , Chairman of MHRA ( at 1.22.18 ) : Significant investment by NIBSC and also its partners the Gates foundation and of course its part of the WHO lab in ( indecipherable ) and of course basically premiere eradication .\nThere are three strains of polio and the team at NIBSC developed three different vaccines .\nIt happens that strain two is the one that has been deployed most in clinical trials in Africa and it 's listed product by the WHO which mean it can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not proved .\nWe are now moving to clinical trials with the other two strains as well , so it 's very exciting : it 's a huge huge combination : its effect is that this vaccine can not revert .\nSo the Salk vaccine which was used with most of us as kids there was always a low chance of it reverting back to wild type which means things like polio begins to appear in the population .\nThis is a great leap forward here because it ca n't revert so basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a great example of how the MHRA is different from other regulators around the world because we have NIBSC or National Institute for Biological Standards and Control where do some basic looking at fundamental research and this is a good example of the work that we are doing in that area and the public health benefit it can have internationally and not just in the UK so I think actually as regulator we 've got some really important you know constituent parts that actually make us a very strong and capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the MHRA ever was functionally a \u201c regulator \u201d it has abandoned this role to facilitate business , it even trades with industry in Coronavirus spike-protein .\nThis was emphasised in an earlier UK Column report when MHRA CEO June Raine excruciatingly discussed transforming the MHRA in 2020 from being \u201c a regulator to an enabler \u201d ( at 47.30 ) .\nAnd of course it is a whole different level of concern if the MHRA not only received research funding from the Gates Foundation as has previously been identified but is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WHO ) .\nOf course , the pretext was that there was an emergency and this was in the most formal bureaucratic terms an outright lie .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url":

sign language .\nI \u2019 d used sign language while teaching , not because I had students who needed me to sign to them , but because it was a neat skill I learned that I wanted to share with my students .\nLater , as a young mom , I used it when Fiona was a toddler .\nShe picked it up very quickly and actually preferred to sign even though she had expressive verbal language skills .\nWhen Ronan began to go silent , I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him .\nWe knew he could hear us .\nWe knew he wanted to tell us something .\nBut he could only vocalize - not verbalize , his responses .\nBesides starting to label everything in the house with index cards or flashcards with names of objects , we began to sign everything we could for Ronan .\nThe day he put \u2018 two and two together \u2019 was an amazing day .\nHe signed ball after seeing a picture of a ball .\nHe turned and signed ball toward me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image was .\nI was floored .\nI was so excited and motivated to teach him more !\nRonan was all of that , too , including on the day that Ronan signed cookie and immediately got a cookie to eat .\nMy own children were drawn to print-rich items in our home environment - toddler books , children \u2019 s magazines , puzzles , flash cards .\nEven though Ronan would later be enrolled full-time in a preschool that served children with special needs , he \u2019 d still see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining room where my typical children would be homeschooled .\nRonan learned to read early , like his big sister did .\nShe was 3 years old , he was around 5 years old .\nI remember that both Fiona and Ronan loved books .\nWhen they were very young , I spent quite a bit of time reading aloud to them , beginning when they were newborns thanks to Jim Trelease \u2019 s The Read-Aloud Handbook .\nIt was one of the best tools I \u2019 d discovered as an early education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my classroom , I was excited to be able to also with my own children .\n[ I hadn \u2019 t realized how much I wrote in reply until I began to edit this post on Saturday morning .\nBut like I said , I spent days thinking about those great questions I was asked .\nHere \u2019 s a bit of history with hopefully some helpful information for other moms and dads . ]\nSuch great questions !\nI \u2019 ve thought about all of them every single day over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give his youngest sister , and one that I use when other children ask about him , is that Ronan experienced typical speech and development skills , and then he didn \u2019 t .\nHis oldest sister remembers hearing Ronan being verbal .\nBut the few words he had started to fade , as did other skills he \u2019 d mastered .\nI didn \u2019 t give a huge scientific explanation to my daughter , even though she knows the medical history that played a role in that loss of speech .\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell us what he wants and needs verbally , he \u2019 s wowed us with other forms of communication .\nHe can read , type , sign and gesture lots of things !\nThat brings me to answering some of the next set of questions that Emmaphiladelphia asked .\nHow did Ronan learn to read and type ?\nThese are complex global skills that show high intelligence .\nYou are a writer .\nRonan may have inherited your language skills .\nIs he now able to type full descriptive narratives ?\nDoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can he read cartoons ?\nThe second set of questions were in the comments of last week \u2019 s Sunday post from one of our long-time readers .\nShe asked : If Ronan can make sounds with his vocal chords , why ca n't he talk ?\nHe can make sounds , but why ca n't he put them together ?\nI was asked two sets of great questions in the last week .\nThe first ones were from Ronan \u2019 s young sister : In the early stages , he \u2019 d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day .\nThen he \u2019 d learn up to 5 signs at a time .\nBefore the end of kindergarten , we \u2019 d taught him 125 signs at home !\nIt was pretty incredible .\nSomething else that was incredible was realizing that Ronan taught himself to read .\nI discovered that one afternoon that same year while Ronan was looking through a stack of flashcards .\nI had several kinds - ones I \u2019 d made , some that I \u2019 d purchased , and some that were given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been using with Ronan to teach him signs had words and a photo .\nI \u2019 d show him the photo , sign the word , and then point to the word .\nThat stack was of household items - a picture of a spoon with the word spoon under it , a house with a picture of a house\u2026a book\u2026a baby .\nWe had other sets of cards with sight words that only had the sight word printed on the cards , no images .\nIt was this stack that Ronan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking from the playroom to the kitchen when I saw Ronan sitting on the floor looking at the cards .\nHe signed something to himself , then looked at another card and did the same thing .\nI stopped and stared .\nThen I shuffled the cards and asked him to sign what he saw : Shuffling the cards , and adding a few more in that I had never introduced to him , I asked him to show me the signs .\nHe signed each and every word correctly .\nI couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d taught himself with the print-only cards that I was using for his siblings \u2019 lessons .\nI recorded some great memories of that time : - I \u2019 m watching Ronan babble to himself in sign language .\nHe is so smart and \u2018 chatty \u2019 .\nI hope one day to hear his words .\nHe \u2019 s started doing the *whispering of noise phase I read about .\n- I \u2019 m watching Ronan \u2018 talk \u2019 to his shadow .\nHe is using sign language and fingerspelling .\n-Ronan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nThank God he can sign his response .\nHe is so fricken smart !\n[ *I wish I could remember which book I read that whispering bit in !\nI was reading so much back then but can \u2019 t recall which author mentioned that . ]\nIn the evenings over the next few months , I tried to use the Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons book with Ronan like I \u2019 d used with Fiona .\nBut I could not figure out how to get Ronan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page .\nSure , he had tons of signs at that point , but if he didn \u2019 t have a sign for a word , he could not show me he understood what was printed .\nReading was not part of Ronan \u2019 s formal school lessons or in his education plan , so we continued to teach Ronan as many signs as we could after school at home in the evenings .\nWe also continued to label and narrate as much as we could also .\nWhere he couldn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ronan was showing some fine motor control with fingerspelling .\nThat ability opened another chance for more communication .\nA year or so later , during an evaluation for a speech output device , one of the evaluators asked if he could point .\n\u201c Can he point and type ?\n\u201d she asked .\nUp until then , I \u2019 d never asked Ronan to type anything .\nI \u2019 d never thought to .\nWell , just like signing and reading opened his world , Ronan also figured out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs .\nFrom a memory from 2011 after he \u2019 d gained some typing skills : Typing with Ronan on a Friday night .\nIf Ronan does n't spell the word right away I fingerspell or sound it out phonetically .\n( I also add the spaces in between the words . )\nHe 's such a good hunt and peck typist , he knows where the keys are and is happy with the results -- seeing the word , tracing some of the letters on the computer screen and then waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] movie clip .\nAmazing .\nFinding that memory made me want to look for more .\nThis one was from 2013 , with one of his Dream Team teachers who moved mountains with us : Best day for Ronan all week ( thank you , Lord , he so needed a good day ) !\nThey are doing a reading assessment with him at school and want to ramp up teaching more spelling since we all know the kid can do it .\nWe do n't know what he 's taught himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some more help and up his game is awesome .\nAt one point during the testing , his teacher asked Ronan to type in words he knew .\nHe types the usual : Baby Einstein , snack , Wii .\nSo , she says , \u201c Can you type in my words ( shows him the list ) ?\n\u201d We just typed out some words together here at home .\nI said them , he wrote them .\nThis is only a partial list because he was more interested in where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I could tell Ronan was getting tired .\nHe was pretty much done with me at this point so I said , Are you finished ?\nHe typed : fishd ( finished ) We 'll catch up , Buddy .\nDo n't you worry .\nMommy wo n't quit on you .\nAnd another story from that same year : Love my Ronan .\nI am getting him dressed and sign his delicious breakfast menu to him : eggs , waffle , bacon , milk and juice .\nHe looks at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` cake '' .\nHe signs `` yes '' and repeats the sign .\nGot ta get that kid a cake .\nGood thing we have a stash of GF cupcakes in the freezer for special occasions like this .\nCake for breakfast just because you are amazing , Ronan Jameson .\nHe really is amazing .\nBut some days , he \u2019 s not so happy .\nWhile searching for those sweet stories , this one from 2015 popped up : Ronan was up a little earlier than usual and must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual today .\nRonan used sign language and fingerspelling to tell me something when I was getting him changed : Poor kiddo .\nHe was sad .\nHe loves that Daddy of his .\nWhen he can \u2019 t tell me he \u2019 s sad or that something is hurting

except for the fact that every crackdown and step backward correspond to an increase in the number of Americans who view vaccine safety as a research priority or who suspect the tech is not as safe as claimed .\nThose shifts were inevitable but hardly victories since the aim had been to better the system before the damage , cost and jaundice spread .\nEven with recent successes against removal of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusades against vaccine exemptions continue to spread , federal enforcement still looms , and vaccine safety and autism activists seem farther away from original goals .\nTo make matters worse , in the case an individual is disabled by vaccination\u2014an indisputed risk of a technology ruled \u201c unavoidably unsafe \u201d by the Supreme Court and the reason for the existence of the VICP\u2014 the treatment of the disabled in the US , including disabled veterans , is increasingly lethal and deplorable .\nAnd even those few awarded compensation in vaccine court would most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressively narrowing parameters set by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices .\nBut it finally dawned on me that this is the type of reporting that can only happen from the bottom\u2014from sources with little to lose but themselves\u2014both because the view from political purgatory has a certain clarity and because activists and analysts who focus on broader political scopes generally have other life and death issues hinging on their ability and agency to get a their perspectives into the wider media .\nWhen they go down , so does the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nLike Engelhardt , only moreso , I also feel out of my depth with the issue of militarized \u201c globalization \u201d as it relates to the pharmaceutical crusade against consumer rights .\nOthers have named these things separately and I \u2019 ve waited patiently for years for leading political analysts and activists to put the pieces together .\nTom Dispatch has been an important media source for the following report and I generally agree with the substance of the article\u20141 % elections , demobilization of Americans , privatization of everything and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nI agree on every count except one\u2014that any of this is new or lacks a name .\nHave you ever undertaken some task you felt less than qualified for , but knew that someone needed to do ?\nConsider this piece my version of that , and let me put what I do understand about it in a nutshell : based on developments in our post-9/11 world , we could be watching the birth of a new American political system and way of governing for which , as yet , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we feature the brilliant Adriana Gamondes , who predicted the state of plague in which we now live back in 2015 in a scathing 10 part series .\nHer work for us over the years we were fortunate to have her on our team stood out as our very best .\nSeveral of us have been trying to reach out to her - to no avail .\nA mutual friend alerted me that she is alive and well , for which I am grateful & relieved .\nI 'm taking a Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect time to share the 10 part series , and of course , Cathy on Sunday .\nPlease shire this series far and wide .\nThank you .\nKim The plague-stricken town , traversed throughout with hierarchy , surveillance , observation , writing ; the town immobilized by the functioning of an extensive power that bears in a distinct way over all individual bodies - this is the utopia of the perfectly governed city .\nThe plague ( envisaged as a possibility at least ) is the trial in the course of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary power .\nIn order to make rights and laws function according to pure theory , the jurists place themselves in imagination in the state of nature ; in order to see perfect disciplines functioning , rulers dreamt of the state of plague .\nAll of this eventually led me to the realization that the war against balanced public health reporting in the US\u2014one that effectively turns the subject into a career-burning swan song for any prominent journalist or public figure who dares to question the paradigm\u2014 is overwhelmingly political and has far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even industry profits than protecting the paradigm itself and its multiple unstated applications .\nThe use of public health campaigns for purposes other than actual public health could be seen as a sort of coercive tied selling .\nExcept that , with the vaccine program , we \u2019 re arguably getting a side of targeted killings , drones , hegemony and expansionism , mass surveillance , radical economic programs including the privatization of education , an increasingly captured media , and yet another rationale for domestic militarization .\nIn other words , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary cause that would necessarily gain ground on a wave of political reconstruction if only , say , Citizens United were rolled back , if environmental protections were improved , if Halliburton-style privatization schemes were cut from the taxpayer teat , if regulatory capture could be curtailed , or if media and academia reclaimed freedom from corporate bondage , etc .\nIntead it \u2019 s a linchpin issue and perpetual entry point for the rest to stay as is or grow worse .\nIn the battle to retain rights , addressing those being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an avoidable morass but , at this moment , only the \u201c dead \u201d will name it .\nBy now , most of the country is aware that those dissenting from official public health doctrine on vaccination are facing potential threats of jail ( USA Today , Washington Post , LA Times ) , segregation ( National Public Radio ) , fines and civil suits ( Forbes ) .\nThe public has seen the media celebrating state child removal as a tool of vaccine enforcement ( Daily Kos ) , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to parents but to the state ( USA Today ) .\nIt seems unlikely that all this is happening due to an outbreak of measles that seems to have run its course , was far smaller than last year \u2019 s , has so far involved zero deaths in the US , and is largely attributable\u2014like the 2010 pertussis spike\u2014 to vaccine failure , not a drop in uptake .\nThe fact that the current rash of state campaigns to remove exemptions followed directly on the heels of several whistleblower disclosures regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and autism suggests triggers other than measles might be pushing the agenda forward\u2014one apparently bent on locking down consumers before whistleblower hearings set for spring potentially lead to mass opt-outs .\nConsidering that 1/3 of US children are now living in poverty , it \u2019 s disturbing that the same seemingly progressive media outlets decrying municipal violation traps , state child snatching for profit and the criminalization of American life are simultaneously stumping for mandates .\nSince this is also happening in conjunction with a campaign for a universal adult mandate and tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 vaccines in the approval pipeline , this could eventually push even the most compliant consumers past their limits and into legal standoffs that most can \u2019 t afford .\nBut some might argue that , in the post 9/11 disaster capitalism era , triggering mass dissent might be part of the scheme , or at least easily enfolded into it .\nThe list of corporations profiting from prison labor should be a prime illustration .\nFrom Truthdig : `` Abbott Laboratories , AT & T , AutoZone , Bank of America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caterpillar ,

would certainly be a boon for privatized probation corporations , privatized prisons and privatized foster care used in some regions to balance budgets .\nBut what exactly would it do for faith in preventive medicine ?\nBorrowing a term from Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling , the current assaults on consumer rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two senses\u2014 one intentional and the other unintended .\nFirst , it \u2019 s an attempted \u201c integrity assassination \u201d of independent science that rightfully watchdogs the safety and efficacy of vaccination , and an attempt to outlaw a diverse consumer safety movement .\nBut it \u2019 s also an inadvertent manual for political suicide on the part of vaccine industrialists and public health authorities responsible for sustaining the vaccine program .\nIn his novel Dark Green , Bright Red , Gore Vidal wrote \u201c \u2026all the great impatient men who eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stratosphere of indulged will .\nMen who must tumble down and , in the tumbling , smash , if not themselves , the beloved image of their dreaming.\n\u201d Or put more directly , the vaccine industry and public health proponents , over-ballasted with too many interlocking political and corporate agendas , are in the process of smashing , if not themselves , then any remnant of trust in public health .\nThe agenda ballast goes far beyond domestic mandates and , consequently , the distrust has gone global .\nOn May 16th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top counterterrorism and homeland security advisor Lisa Monaco penned a letter to the deans of 13 schools of public health vowing that the CIA will cease using vaccine campaigns abroad as cover for military and surveillance missions .\nMonaco \u2019 s letter surfaced a few days later , on May 18th .\nFrom Fox News : President Obama 's top counterterrorism advisor has vowed that the CIA will no longer be able to use vaccination programs as cover for intelligence operations like those the agency carried out prior to the killing of Usama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced the policy change last week in a letter to the deans of 13 schools of public health .\nMonaco 's letter said that the CIA has agreed to stop using vaccination programs and workers for intelligence purposes .\nThe agency has also agreed not to use genetic material obtained through such programs .\nThe educators had written to Obama last year protesting the use of immunization programs as a front for espionage .\nThe most prominent program [ emphasis added ] was run by Dr. Shakil Afridi , who offered hepatitis vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover for his CIA-backed effort to obtain DNA samples from children at a compound where bin Laden was later killed during a 2011 raid by U.S. Navy SEALs .\nAfridi was convicted and sentenced by a Pakistani court to 33 years in prison for treason .\nThe sentence was later overturned and Afridi faces a retrial .\nIn 2012 , the United Nations suspended a polio vaccination effort in Pakistan after gunmen killed several health workers .\nTaliban militants accused health workers of acting as spies for the U.S\u2026 The CIA 's use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden 's compound undercut Obama 's own high-profile speech to the Muslim world in 2009 , in which he touted U.S. efforts to slash the growth of polio in Pakistan , Afghanistan and Nigeria .\nWith Obama administration assurances , Muslim scholars in two international groups issued religious decrees urging parents to vaccinate their children .\nNotice the pluralization and time frame from the Fox News excerpt above : \u201c vaccination programs as cover for intelligence operations\u2026like those the agency carried out prior to the killing of Usama Bin Laden in 2011.\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine campaigns abroad before and after the Neptune Spear mission to kill Bin Laden was driven mostly by the reported connection between immunization drives and drone strikes in Pakistan\u2014also plural .\nUntil details are declassified or leaked , we \u2019 re left to envision troops of health workers doubling as spies , gathering local intel throughout target zones in Pakistan or elsewhere to coordinate strikes that have reportedly killed an estimated 1,147 civilian \u201c unknowns \u201d , including hundreds of children , in order to target an estimated 41 suspected combatants\u2014 a rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nJustice for 9/11 clearly isn \u2019 t served by misuse of health programs and further civilian deaths , nor is domestic safety .\nAs Wikileaks recently disclosed , an internal CIA analysis of the drone program rates the so-called targeted killings of \u201c High Value Targets \u201d as less than a success for reasons other than the \u201c unintentional \u201d civilian casualty rate .\nThe program , analysts conclude , does not consistently reduce insurgency .\nAdd to this reports that several terrorist attacks have occurred since the National Security Agency has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the CIA \u201c Torture Report \u201d has concluded that \u201c enhanced interrogation techniques \u201d \u2014 techniques such as waterboarding , beatings , isolation , extreme exposure and , as journalist Seymour Hersh charged , rapes of children in front of their mothers\u2014did not prevent a single act of terrorism .\nAbsent evidence that broken treaties on human rights and medical ethics have been effective in improving the safety of Americans , it might appear that these operations are some kind of vast , maccabre experiment .\nIn fact , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than acting as a key recruiting tool for militant extremists\u2014 was government funded research on the \u201c science of torture.\n\u201d By the same token , the one vaccination drive used as cover for a military operation the public knows about\u2014 the Bin Laden mission\u2014 couldn \u2019 t have produced immunity to the disease being vaccinated for .\nIn an article from 2012 titled The Imperial Mind , Glenn Greenwald wrote , Americans of all types \u2014 Democrats and Republicans , even some Good Progressives \u2014 are just livid that a Pakistani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistani officials ) has imposed a 33-year prison sentence on Shakil Afridi , the Pakistani physician who secretly worked with the CIA to find Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil .\nTheir fury tracks the standard American media narrative : by punishing Dr. Afridi for the \u201c crime \u201d of helping the U.S. find bin Laden , Pakistan has revealed that it sympathizes with Al Qaeda and is hostile to the U.S. ( NPR headline : \u201c 33 Years In Prison For Pakistani Doctor Who Aided Hunt For Bin Laden \u201d ; NYT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.I.A .\nFind Bin Laden \u201d ) .\nExcept that \u2019 s a woefully incomplete narrative : incomplete to the point of being quite misleading .\nWhat Dr. Afridi actually did was concoct a pretextual vaccination program , whereby Pakistani children would be injected with a single Hepatitis B vaccine , with the hope of gaining access to the Abbottabad house where the CIA believed bin Laden was located .\nThe plan was that , under the ruse of vaccinating the children in that province , he would obtain DNA samples that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bin Laden family .\nBut the vaccine program he was administering was fake : as Wired \u2018 s public health reporter Maryn McKenna detailed , \u201c since only

are nearly ubiquitous .\nThe same is true for US military operations , as Nick Turse for The Nation reports : And as it turns out , Gates \u2019 investment coincided with several ongoing US military operations and installations in countries \u2014from the Ukraine to Syria , Yemen and Kenya \u2014 openly touted for oil , frackable shale or offshore gas fields .\nAnd every one of these countries had been , at one point or another , a subject of the Bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshoot ) GAVI Alliance \u2019 s various disease monitoring and vaccination drives as well as surveillance of what the organization calls \u201c vaccine confidence .\n\u201d In February , 2011 , less than three months prior to Operation Neptune Spear , Microsoft founder Bill Gates , the world \u2019 s leading vaccine philanthropist , pronounced on CNN that vaccine safety critics \u201c kill children \u201d and are \u201c liars.\n\u201d A few weeks earlier , Gates had invested in Neos Geosolutions , a mining technology company backed by Goldman Sachs and Saudi investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East and maintains an office in Abu Dhabi .\nRead Part 1 here .\nNote : We are running one of Adriana 's finest series this week while Kim is on a brief vacation until August 1 .\nBy Adriana Gamondes During the fiscal year that ended on September 30 , 2014 , US Special Operations forces ( SOF ) deployed to 133 countries\u2014roughly 70 percent of the nations on the planet\u2014according to Lieutenant Colonel Robert Bockholt , a public affairs officer with US Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) .\nThis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country \u2019 s most elite forces were active in more than 150 different countries around the world , conducting missions ranging from kill/capture night raids to training exercises .\nBut aside from the ubiquity of certain programs , there are other convergences that make the chain of events leading up to Neptune Spear interesting .\nImagining for a moment that Gates , whose foundation has been called a tax evasion shell by philanthropist and accounting expert Sheldon Drobny , has never used medical philanthropy to advance other investments , we should still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation\u2014the prime implementers of third world vaccination drives similar to the one used as cover for the Bin Laden mission , and one of the primary media forces behind domestic mandates\u2014 may have known leading up to the operation .\nWas Gates briefed ?\nWere other media and industrial players ?\nWe may never know the answer to this , as Turse goes on to illustrate : Despite its massive scale and scope , this secret global war across much of the planet is unknown to most Americans .\nUnlike the December debacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special ops missions remain completely in the shadows , hidden from external oversight or press scrutiny .\nIn fact , aside from modest amounts of information disclosed through highly-selective coverage by military media , official White House leaks , SEALs with something to sell and a few cherry-picked journalists reporting on cherry-picked opportunities , much of what America \u2019 s special operators do is never subjected to meaningful examination , which only increases the chances of unforeseen blowback and catastrophic consequences .\nThe use of illegal domestic propaganda to facilitate military operations has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most notably Judy Miller \u2019 s planting of WMD spin in the New York Times on behalf of the US State Department .\nAnd going by a shocking recent court ruling , it \u2019 s just become harder to prove .\nIn a story for The Intercept , Glenn Greenwald reports , A truly stunning debasement of the U.S. justice system just occurred through the joint efforts of the Obama Justice Department and a meek and frightened Obama-appointed federal judge , Edgardo Ramos , all in order to protect an extremist neocon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of neocon extremists was literally just immunized by a federal court from the rule of law .\nThat was based on the claim \u2014 advocated by the Obama DOJ and accepted by Judge Ramos \u2014 that subjecting them to litigation for their actions would risk disclosure of vital \u201c state secrets.\n\u201d The court \u2019 s ruling was based on assertions made through completely secret proceedings between the court and the U.S. government , with everyone else \u2014 including the lawyers for the parties \u2014 kept in the dark\u2026 But in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government conduct at issue in the lawsuit .\nAt least based on what they claim about themselves , UANI is just \u201c a not-for-profit , non-partisan , advocacy group \u201d that seeks to \u201c educate \u201d the public about the dangers of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\nWhy would such a group like this even possess \u201c state secrets \u201d ?\nIt would be illegal to give them such material .\nOr could it be that the CIA or some other U.S. government agency has created and controls the group , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which happens to be illegal ?\nOne clear takeaway is the fact that any agenda , if combined with military intelligence , now enjoys the unconstitutionally broad , secretive cover afforded to \u201c state security.\n\u201d About the only way to find out whether Gates was privy to and abetting government plans would be to somehow sue him for defamation over his CNN statements against consumer advocates and wait for the DOJ to swoop in .\nOf course anyone doing so would be accused of simultaneously defending Bin Laden and endangering public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the double accountability shield of the war on terror and the war on disease\u2014 two things that are equally handy for destroying constitutional protections and rationalizing fallout .\nAnd whether or not Gates participated in illegal propaganda , considering the 47,500 cases of flaccid paralysis following the Gates Foundation \u2019 s live oral polio vaccine campaign in the third world , ethics violations in vaccine trials , reliance on repressive regimes for implementation of those trials ( discussed later in the series ) , in light of the foundation \u2019 s commitment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of the admission that vaccine drives have been repeatedly used as a cover for military operations , it \u2019 s become apparent that medical philanthropy has not always improved public health in foreign populations .\nFrom some of his foundation \u2019 s further investments , it \u2019 s apparent that human health may not even be a driving force for Gates .\nDrawing from the motives behind US expansionist policies , it may be that these philanthropic medical campaigns are more a classic manner of gathering intelligence and capturing health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral rich target nations as a militarized Trojan horse operation to gain control of populations and resources .\nObviously the spread of vaccine criticism would be viewed as a threat to any compounded operation like this , and the confluence of events should trigger concern , as should media campaigns to spin even the most moderate and reasonable criticism of vaccine safety , efficacy and research integrity as extremist and akin to terrorism .\nBut it \u2019 s not as if disease-mongering in service of military and authoritarian agendas is a new phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public mind .\nIn 20th century modernist philosopher Michel Foucault \u2019 s concept of \u201c panoticism , \u201d the surveillance state is literally modeled on the city in quarantine , the total control of which is dependent on the existance of a deadly contagion to justify incursons on freedom and privacy .\nA panopticon ( pan , all ; optic , see= \u201c all-seeing \u201d ) was originally conceived as a prison plan by 19th century utopian philosopher Jeremy Bentham to replace corporal punishment with psychological constraint .\nThe panotic prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding a central observation tower whereby every gesture of every prisoner can be supervised around the clock both by guards ( the \u201c state \u201d in Foucault \u2019 s analogy ) and by other prisoners , turning the watched into watchers and creating a system of informants which would presumably normalize conduct and otpimize conformity .\nDespite occasional grumbling in the alternative media that the mainstream has repeatedly sensationalized various outbreaks\u2014 the most recent being SARS , anthrax , Marburg , swine flu and Ebola\u2014 the most cynical interpretations of it usually stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells disease for profit or that the media has a stake in stoking panic as distraction and to boost ratings .\nBoth takes are true , but ten years ago , journalist and Dirty Wars documentarian Jeremy Scahill , the son of healthcare professionals , took a closer look at the phenomenon in Huffington Post , tying disease mongering to WMD spin and war-footing : Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby was a busy man in 2002-2003 , pushing the lie that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and targeting those who dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the leaking and smearing they were doing , Libby and his `` former '' boss Dick Cheney found the time to conduct a parallel propaganda war in which they attempted to use the US public as guinea pigs .\nAnd once again , Judy Miller served as a crucial PR agent for the cause .\nIn mid-2002 , as they struggled desperately to sell the war , these key players in `` Plamegate '' were engaged in full-out offensive aimed at convincing Americans that the country faced an imminent threat of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat , '' Libby began fanatically pressing to have the entire US population preemptively vaccinated against smallpox ( which was declared eradicated in 1980 ) .\nThe proposal was immediately met with opposition from public health experts , including those at the Department of Health and Human Services .\nThey warned Libby that the vaccine could injure , even kill people and that a universal vaccination could in and of itself spark a public health crisis in the US .\n`` The risks of vaccinating the whole country with the existing vaccine were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat , '' says Jerry Hauer , the HHS official at the time that would have been in charge of implementing the vaccinations .\n`` We felt it was the wrong thing from a public health perspective to do . ''\nAs the administration did with so many independent experts who said Iraq posed no WMD threat , Libby attempted to sideline those who questioned him .\nWhat Hauer and his colleagues at HHS may not have known is that smallpox was a career-long obsession of Libby 's -- so much so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germ Boy . ''\nHis 1996 novel , The Apprentice , is about a smallpox outbreak and it was one of Libby 's main areas of concern when he worked under Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz at the Pentagon during the Gulf War .\nIn Judy Miller 's 2001 book ( written with 2 colleagues ) `` Germs : Biological Weapons and America 's Secret War , '' Libby is described during his time at the Pentagon as `` a trim , boyish lawyer '' irritated by intelligence reports about Iraqi WMDs containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly . ''\nMiller writes that Libby `` told colleagues that intelligence analysts had an unfortunate habit : If they did not see a report on something , they assumed it did not exist . ''\nMore than a decade later , Libby was facing renewed frustration with another group of experts challenging his obsession .\nHauer says that when he and other public health officials presented their opposition to Libby 's `` hysterical '' universal smallpox vaccination scheme , the pressure from Cheney 's office increased .\nTo make matters worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Senator/Dr .\nBill Frist , is pushing legislation that would strip people injured by vaccines of their right to sue manufacturers and would virtually eliminate pharmaceutical corporate accountability .\nThe legislation would also make the newly created Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency the only federal agency exempt from the Freedom of Information Act .\nNow , there is grave concern that the man responsible for coordinating the federal response to a flu pandemic or bioterror attack could well be the next `` Brownie . ''\nHis name is Stewart Simonson -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with zero public health management or medical expertise , whose previous job was as a corporate lawyer for Amtrak .\nHe replaced Jerry Hauer , the HHS official who stood up to Libby 's smallpox vaccination scheme .\nHauer says that in replacing him with Simonson the Administration has `` somebody they know will go along with pretty much anything they want . ''\nScahill arguably makes the point that it is at the \u201c biowarfare \u201d juncture mingling disease management more closely than ever with \u201c security \u201d interests that reasonable voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who would happily militarize the function of health regulatory institutions at the potential cost of public health and trust .\nScahill expanded the panoptic theme in an article titled Germ Boys and Yes Men for The Nation : In early November George W. Bush , struggling to claw his way upward in polls that had acquired the consistency of quicksand after two months of blunders and disasters , launched a new PR blitz .\nThe Administration declared it was taking charge of the nation 's health and security with an all-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted with vaccines provided by well-connected pharmaceutical companies ) .\n`` Our country has been given fair warning of this danger to our homeland , '' Bush declared .\n`` It 's my responsibility as President to take measures now to protect the American people . ''\nOne of the things that happens to any issue given a \u201c war on \u201d suffix ( war on disease , war on drugs , war on terror ) is that wars on social problems inevitably identify human enemies .\nIn a paper entitled War as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valparaiso University writes , \u2026today \u2019 s increasing use of militaristic rhetoric by politicians and pundits goes beyond its metaphorical use as a war against an abstraction .\nInstead , the use of such language is becoming literal , and that rhetorical shift matters .\nToday \u2019 s militaristic rhetoric is increasingly identifying fellow citizens as enemies in a literal war\u2026we have crossed the line from the marketing use of the metaphorical militarization to actual militarization .\nSomewhere in the last thirty or forty years , we have found it too easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nSince former Health and Human Services director Kathleen Sebelius ( who , like Libby \u2019 s pick to replace noncompliant HHS official Jerry Hauer , is a lawyer , not a medical or scientific expert ) issued her \u201c loose lips sink ships \u201d edict in 2010 for censorship of vaccine and public health criticism in Reader \u2019 s Digest , frank interpretations like Scahill \u2019 s have tapered off .\nAny reporter who presently breaks rank on the subject risks being hounded by astroturf media hordes , branded a danger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the rules of engagement in actual war .\nMy question is whether the power boost received by public health and the pharmaceutical industry via a military-industrial merger has been somehow reciprocal .\nCould the idea that the panoptic surveillance state model evolved from the management of contagion partly explain the growing ferocity of pharmaceutical industry PR and captured public health machinery in defending policy like vaccination\u2014particularly in that this is happening with the emergence of a massive security apparatus ?\nIs it possible that incentives for it extend beyond immediate profits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausibly rest\u2014more or less\u2014 on a protection racket construct fueled by various concepts of contagion , whether literal , figurative or both ?\nAs with anti-terrorism campaigns , a public health protection racket depends on the public \u2019 s dutiful panic in the face of a deadly menace that appears to be more imminent than ( thus supplanting fears of ) longstanding human-wrought threats such as pollution and climate change , disasters stemming from genetically modified seed technology , oil spills , fracking disasters and attendant water shortages , etc .\nTo work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state \u2019 s role as protector , absolute faith in technology , and grateful relinquishment of rights and privacy in exchange for supposed safety .\nBut in case the public can \u2019 t be persuaded to accept the tradeoff , there \u2019 s always legislation to force the issue that continues to ride the tails of various draconian post-9/11 anti-terrorism policies : \u2022 The Project BioShield Act of 2004 ( S. 15 ) became law on July 21 of that year \u201c to provide protections and countermeasures against chemical , radiological , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a terrorist attack against the United States by giving the National Institutes of Health contracting flexibility , infrastructure improvements , and expediting the scientific peer review process , and streamlining the Food and Drug Administration approval process of countermeasures.\n\u201d The act was also meant to incentivize the pharmaceutical industry to support national security .\n\u2022 The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness ( PREP ) Act was quietly signed into law by George Bush as part of the 2006 Defense Appropriations Act ( HR 2863 ) .\nIt lets the HHS Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency requiring mandatory vaccinations .\nNothing in the Act lists criteria that warrant a threat .\nPotential penalties aren \u2019 t specified for those who resist but fines and quarantine are likely .\nThe HHS web site also says the Secretary may \u201c issue a declaration\u2026.that provides immunity from tort liability ( except for willful misconduct ) for claims of loss caused , arising out of , relating to , or resulting from administration or use of ( vaccine or other pharmaceutical ) countermeasures to diseases , threats and conditions determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible risk of a future public health emergency\u2026.\n\u201d \u2022 The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act ( S. 3678 ) , effective December 19 , 2006 , amended \u201c the Public Health Service Act with respect to public health security and all-hazards preparedness and response , and for other purposes.\n\u201d \u2022 The Model State Emergency Health Powers Act ( MSEHPA )

declarations of public health emergency at the international , national , state , and local levels\u2026.\n\u201d MSEHPA has been criticized as \u201c overly paternalistic.\n\u201d ACLU continues on the subject of MSEHPA : It \u2019 s \u201c written in a way that doesn \u2019 t adequately protect citizens against the misuse of the tremendous powers that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s ) replete with

.\n( It ) could have serious consequences for individuals \u2019 freedom , privacy , and equality.\n\u201d ( 2 ) \u201c It goes well beyond bioterrorism ( with ) an over-broad definition of \u2018 public health emergency \u201d that may be anything a local or national authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence for proof .\n\u2022 \u2026Massachusetts Senate unanimously passed a pandemic flu preparation bill that rises to the level of martial law .\nIf approved by the House and signed into law , it will mandate among other measures : \u2022 \u201c vaccination , treatment , examination , or testing of \u201d all individuals involved in providing health care \u2013 as perhaps step one before ordering the same process for all state residents ; \u2022 owners or occupiers of all premises \u201c to permit entry into and investigation of the premises ; \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all suspected facilities ; and restricting or prohibiting \u201c assemblages of persons.\n\u201d By gearing the security state to monitor and manage actual as well as conceptual political contagion , it creates the potential for a strange , moebius strip reality where just as one Trojan horse for incursions on privacy

Gamondes Through a panoptic lens , the surveillance state\u2014the state of plague\u2014 is fueled by contagion whether this is an actuality or a conceptual fabrication , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad genes or bad ideas that , according to several absurd authoritarian interpretations of evolution , spawn mass political psychopathology .\nAnd this is true whether the reigning authoritarian ideology is right , left or the \u201c inverted \u201d variety currently forming in American politics .\nAccording to political philosopher Sheldon Wolin who coined \u201c inverted totalitarianism , \u201d in an inversion of Nazi political structure , corporations rule and government is subordinate , the population is demobilized and apathetic and figureheads are interchangable .\nBut regardless of form , by Foucault \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by definition rooted in a common contagion model and the contagion model in turn is arguably rooted in a cult of science necessary to rationalize the implementation of authoritarian statism on scientific grounds .\nIn the view of French political historian Tzvetan Todorov , a cult implies religion\u2014 a sort of theocracy of \u201c scientism.\n\u201d In his introduction to Hope and Memory , Lessons From the Twentieth Century , Todorov writes , Totalitarian doctrines are instances of utopianism ( the only known instances in the 20th century ) and , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means that they belong , as do all doctrines of salvation , to the field of religion\u2026 All the same , the origins of totalitarian utopianism are quite paradoxical for a religion .\nThey lie in a doctrine that was developed before the rise of totalitarian states , before the twentieth century , and which seems at first glance to have absolutely nothing on common with religion .\nWe must turn now to this earlier ideology , which we shall call \u201c scientism.\n\u201d Scientism as a doctrine starts with the hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent structure .\nIt follows that the world is transparent , that it can be known entirely and without residue by the human mind .\nThe task of acquiring such knowledge is delegated to the requisite praxis , called science .\nThe basic postulate has one obvious consequence \u2026 [ I ] f the transparency of the real includes the human world , then there is nothing to stop us from imagining how to create the \u201c new man , \u201d a human species without the blemishes of the original strain .\nThe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humankind as well\u2026 The notion that social and individual ideals are the products of science has another important consequence\u2026 There is no room for more than one version of scientific truth ; errors are many but the truth is one , and so pluralism becomes an irrelevant concept .\nIf the ideal is a result of demonstration and not of opinion , then it has to be accepted without protest .\nScientism derives from the existence of scientific practice , but it is not itself scientific .\nIt \u2019 s basic postulate\u2014the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proved ; the same is true of its implementation through the construction of ultimate ends through the process of knowledge .\nFrom start to finish , the cult of science requires an act of faith ( \u201c faith in reason , \u201d in Ernest Renan \u2019 s phrase ) , which is why it belongs not to the family of sciences , but to the family of religions\u2026 It has to be emphasized that scientism is not a science , but a world view that grew , fungus-like , on the trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems can embrace the cult of science and still not foster the development of scientific research\u2026 The monism of totalitarian regimes comes from the same axiom of the cult of science .\nBecause there is only one rational way of grasping the entire universe , there is no reason to maintain artificial distinctions between different social groups , between the different spheres of individual life ( public and private ) , and between opinions .\nTruth is one and so should the human world be .\nIt \u2019 s certainly true that research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monism , even driving the head of the Office for Research Integrity , David Wright , to resign due to entrenched corruption and obstruction within the department of Health and Human Services , the parent agency to the CDC .\nThe recent disclosure by senior CDC scientist William Thompson that higher ups in the agency repeatedly forced researchers to alter data regarding the relationship between autism and certain vaccines and vaccine components is merely symptomatic .\nThere are many prevalent theories in science which have been placed protectively behind the absolutist aegis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( officially deemed \u201c largely genetic \u201d ) , and the \u201c unquestionable safety and effectiveness \u201d of certain drugs and biologics another .\nThough a considerable amount of peer-reviewed science exists questioning each , we are told that there are not \u201c two sides \u201d to the controversy , a signature PR soundbite of vaccine defenders like Paul Offit , whose Rotarix vaccine co-patent is currently under official review in France for infant deaths .\nOffit recently repeated the tagline when he backed out of a public debate on learning that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical expert would be featured .\nAnd he used it as an explanation on Democracy Now for why he refused to be interviewed at the same time as NYU law professor and research scholar Mary Holland , a pro-choice proponent : \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s fair to have a debate where two sides are presented , when only one side is really supported by the science .\nI think\u2014I \u2019 d like to think we \u2019 re beyond that.\n\u201d Dr. Offit , what I think is important\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWe \u2019 re talking about science .\nWe \u2019 re talking about the practice of medicine in this country .\nWe \u2019 re talking about public policy .\nI mean , after all , this has now become a presidential campaign issue , with possible presidential candidates taking on the issues .\nAnd I want your comment on that .\nBut you \u2019 re combining all of this , and it \u2019 s important to bring all the various expertise of parents , of lawyers , of doctors together in a conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply makes a key point about scientific absolutism\u2014that it pretends not to be political and therefore not in the purview of political discussion .\nOne problem with this is that , even if certain \u201c majority science \u201d theories eventually proved incontestable , the credibility shields under which they \u2019 ve been protectively sealed can expand to scare back scrutiny from almost anything that scientific authority deems related\u2014no matter how absurd and no matter how it might open the door to dangerous policy .\nA prime example of this is the campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quoting my own 2013 article : Autism research provides an endless supply of unsubstantiated genetic corollaries which have the distinction of being protected by the state in order to obfuscate the role of government public health agencies in contributing to an epidemic .\nAnd , of course , these unsubstantiated genetic corollaries have endless applications for political and industrial exploits\u2026For instance , if a group of researchers needs to prove that pigs fly to serve an industrial sponsor or as part of an exercise in `` weaponized anthropology \u201d targeting a strategic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is link \u201c proofs \u201d of the imaginary flight of pigs to autism to create an automatic credibility shield .\nA year after the above was published , yet another awful , sloppy study attempting to tie terrorism to autism through genetics was published and hit headlines , showing that what happens in autism science hardly stays there .\nIt \u2019 s as if a black hole has formed around the suppression of environmental autism research creating a time warp that continuously spits out old-timey hypotheses worthy of the eugenics era\u2014autistic school shooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the autism-terrorism study ) , autistic dictators , even an autistic-triggered financial crash .\nThere are no limits to the application of something that does not exist .\nNo gene or genes for any of these conditions or behaviors have ever been established , even after a century of hunting down genetic markers for violence and criminality , decades of attempting to pin down \u201c autism genes , \u201d and despite yearly headlines hailing every new , unreplicable genetic discovery as the one that proves x or y at last .\nConveniently sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding , incredibly expensive disabled population has the predictable effect of quelling public concern , opening the door to institutional abuse , an echo of racialized criminal research .\nThe political ramifications should be obvious : the goal is to play genomic Jesus of the scientific Second Coming in order to identify and manage terrorists and assorted other genetic bad seeds from birth .\nThis fits perfectly with Todorov \u2019 s description of scientism as part of a \u201c doctrine of salvation \u201d and is the essence of weaponized science\u2014a term used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaponizing Anthropology , regarding the militarization of the field and the atrocity-justifying junk science that results .\nThe impact of any program drawn from weaponized research tends to be squeamishly left for separate discussion , but whatever solution is proposed , particularly if this poses human rights problems ( from forced screening and intervention to prophylactic drugging and assaults against entire cultures , or the current FBI trend of luring the disabled into fabricated bomb plots ) , it only highlights the importance of the public \u2019 s right to peer behind credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .\nBut in an age when cellular science often dictates domestic and foreign policy , commercial science proponents have essentially forbidden the public from attempting to interpret scientific research .\nIt \u2019 s akin to medieval church canons banning the laity from translating or owning scripture as well as an effective means of disenfranchising the public .\nWe are simply expected to vote , in blind faith , for \u201c science \u201d and whatever is shoved under its banner by political leaders taking unlimited donations from the same corporations which sponsor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the media that peddles it .\nAs Wikileaks documents in its archive of leaked Sony emails disclosing that top Hollywood executives ( including James Rupert Murdoch , former director of GlaxoSmithKline and son of Rupert ) have been recruited to help the United States produce counter-propaganda \u201c to combat Islamic extremism , \u201d the media isn \u2019 t just selling policy , it \u2019 s creating it .\nIn short , \u201c scientific knowledge \u201d has become a brand and legislation is reduced to marketing .\nIt explains why public health avatars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steer any discussion of biotech safety into purely scientific rather than ethical , legal or political contexts in the hopes the predominance of industry-funded science\u2014as if no other exists\u2014 will bring an advantage .\nBut in the end , the attempt to \u201c scientize \u201d ethical and political considerations is a problem in itself and part of the general trend of dragging all fields of thought under the auspices of scientific \u201c fact.\n\u201d That brings up the question of who decides these absolutes .\nTake Google for example\u2014a company that effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to British journalist and international security scholar Nafeez Ahmed , and has been repeatedly warned to stop manipulating search rankings of companies it invests in .\nGoogle recently announced a plan to inoculate the web against the spread of disinformation by ranking online searches by \u201c facts \u201d as digitally determined by the company \u2019 s \u201c Knowledge Vault \u201d ( TM ? )\n.\nWhat I \u2019 m really curious about is what will happen to the search rankings of various political historians and philosophers in the gears of Google \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the very act of trying to arbitrate ideas\u2014 including political thought , philosophy and morality\u2014 according to \u201c science \u201d is political and , as Todorov and others contend , also has an ominous history .\nFor instance , in tackling the origins of 20th century totalitarianism , political philosopher and Holocaust survivor Hannah Arendt argued that what differentiates despotism from totalitarianism is that , in the latter , an individual who becomes a target of the state need not be accused of or have a history of crimes against the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an \u201c objective enemy \u201d \u2014 a \u201c carrier of tendencies \u201d as certainly as they would be the \u201c carrier of a disease.\n\u201d Like Todorov , Arendt viewed this as ideology , not science : The word `` ideology '' seems to imply that an idea can become the subject matter of a science just as animals are the subject matter of zoology , and that the suffix -logy in ideology , as in zoology , indicates nothing but the logoi , the scientific statements made on it .\nIf this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a pseudoscience and a pseudo-philosophy , transgressing at the same time the limitations of science and the limitations of philosophy .\nPolitical philosopher and the father of the scientific method Karl Raimund Popper traced the roots of the \u201c scientific \u201d terror state to Plato , who based his theory of justice on a mystical metabiological Pythagorean theorem for survival of the species in defense of the supposed inherant purity of the enlightened ruling class from the contagion of supposedly lesser castes .\nPopper also warns that any attempt to apply herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic theory \u201d of the state ( society as \u201c herd , \u201d \u201c body \u201d or tribe ) \u2013 \u201c are veiled forms of propaganda for a return to tribalism \u201d \u2014i.e.\n, absolutism , totalitarianism .\nBoth Popper and Arendt conclude that bastardized genetic theories and racialism in various forms largely drive the machinery of total terror and modern authoritarianism .\nPopper exposes Plato \u2019 s acknowledgement that racialism must be fabricated and artificially sustained to erect state control , calling it the \u201c noble lie \u201d and its enforcement \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi eugenics was also a consciously cynical construct : \u201c racism was calculated to be a more powerful ally than any paid agent or secret organization of fifth columnists.\n\u201d What exactly does totalitarian racialism have to do with current coercive public health campaigns ?\nEnough to make Godwin \u2019 s law moot by extending the comparison to every form of totalitarianism and by arguing that the current trend of demonizing and invalidating ( or search-engine deoptimizing ) those who question the absolutes of official science , to the extent that these groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , equates to Arendt \u2019 s \u201c disease carrier \u201d analogy for political caste .\nIt \u2019 s on this basis that a range of human rights advocates have repeatedly attempted to include politicide within the international definition of genocide , since many modern atrocities have been committed against political groups .\nIn Redefining Genocide , Dr. Kok Thay-Eng , research director for Documentations Center of Cambodia , an organization that researches genocide , writes Under the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide adopted in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : ... any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : ( b ) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; ( c ) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; ( d ) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; ( e ) Forcibly transferring children of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally agreed that Convention \u2019 s definition includes only four protected groups ; political groups , which have been the main victims since World War II , should be included .\nIt seems that the perpetrators of World War II \u2019 s genocide , as the French delegates correctly predicted , tried to victimize the four protected groups on political grounds\u2026 Many observers have noted that there was an \u201c under-the-table \u201d compromise made during the Convention to exclude political groups .\nThis was done to secure ratification by member states that feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subject to external interference under the Convention .\nTo boil it down , the attacks on vaccine safety watchdogs\u2014only one of many similar campaigns against consumer movements\u2014 can be interpreted as attacks on political thought in some senses.The very act of questioning a scientific apologia for use of force illustrates very simply the main political stance of medical reform advocacy\u2014 the view that scientific authority must be accountable .\nFor lack of a better way frame this while still accounting for reformists \u2019 political diversity ( right , left , center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been tagged a sort of \u201c postmodernism \u201d \u2014both as a criticism of consumers \u2019 insistence on their right to question scientific authority and in support of that right if not total accord with the context .\nThere are many ways to categorize dissent and the position that authority must account for itself , but the question of whether this qualifies as political is easily answered by industrial PR attempts to brand environmentalists in general as secretly \u201c socialists.\n\u201d Whether this is true or not , once mass incarceration , professional defrocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain ideas , those policies qualify as politicide under Thay-Eng \u2019 s analysis .\nBut as Thay-Eng also points out , there \u2019 s no consensus on what defines politicide .\nThere \u2019 s also no racially equivalent definition for \u201c political caste \u201d in terms of dissent from state sanctioned science , though , as history illustrates , there should be .\nAccording to Todorov , [ S ] cience requires submission to the quest for truth , not submission to dogma .\nCommunists and Nazis thus backed off from the quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Jewish science \u201d ( and did without Einstein \u2019 s theories ) , and the former repudiated \u201c bourgeois biology \u201d ( and jettisoned Mendel \u2019 s genetics ) .\nChallenging Lyssenko \u2019 s biology , Pavlov \u2019 s psychology , or Marr \u2019 s linguistics in the USSR could take you straight to the gulag .\nWhat telling now is that modern dissent from state science itself , much like the issue of race , is subjected to weaponized forms of sociology , genomic science and psychiatry , arguing that views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religiosity .\nThe extremist \u201c anti \u201d suffix is applied to any position even reasonably questioning commercial science -- \u201c anti-GMO , \u201d \u201c anti-psychiatry , \u201d etc .\n-- and this is done without differentiating the grounds by which different individuals dissent\u2014whether they reject the concept of preventive medicine or simply the available corporate renditions of it , whether they see some products as less effective and necessary than others , and whether decisions are made from reading science and interacting within the scientific community , dire personal experience or web rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarred with a superstitious \u201c cognitive bias.\n\u201d Although the vaccine safety advocacy/autism arena is hugely diverse as far as religious and political orientation , by their own terms , public health and industry defenders have come close to politicizing the attacks through the equivocation .\nVaccine industrialist Paul Offit took it a step further by trying to dictate what constitutes \u201c good \u201d and \u201c bad \u201d exercise of faith in his most recent book , Bad Faith : When Religion Undermines Modern Medicine .\nConsumer activists who question vaccine safety are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder .\nBoth speculative diagnoses are characterized as like a \u201c virus , \u201d and both are commonly applied to terrorists\u2014also described as \u201c viral.\n\u201d These concepts along with genetic theories for religiosity and narcissism have been slapped together to propose that carriers of irrational \u201c anti-science \u201d tendencies are doubly in need of quarantine\u2014both physically as vectors of real disease , and conceptually as vectors of dangerous and contagious views .\nAnd then there \u2019 s always misogyny.That \u2019 s generally regarded as political .\nIn a speech opposing California \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemptions for all school children in the state , Robert F. Kennedy Jr. discussed stereotypes typically wielded against consumer advocates : There \u2019 s a kind of Kafkaesque censorship in the news about having a reasonable debate about this issue\u2014a fact-based debate .\nSo instead , we hear a lot of namecalling\u2026 Because they can \u2019 t debate us on the merits , so they call us \u201c anti-vaccine , \u201d they call us hysterical , they call us conspiracy theorists .\nAnd I want people to think when they use that term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be thinking of a parent with a disabled child , because that \u2019 s who these people are .\nAnd I want to say one other thing , this movement that calls you anti-vax , is the most misogynistic movement that I have seen in my lifetime .\nIt \u2019 s a movement that is anti-mother , and it is anti-woman .\nAnd the names that I hear coming out of people \u2019 s mouths about \u201c hysterics \u201d and \u201c refrigerator moms \u201d and all of this in our major newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary .\nThe accusation of \u201c hysteria , \u201d particularly when leveled by corporate media science writers , is very interesting .\nAn unambiguous reference to the more modern-sounding \u201c conversion \u201d or somatoform disorder , \u201c psychogenic hysteria , \u201d according to law and history professor Barbara Young Welke , author of Recasting American Liberty : Gender , Race , Law , and the Railroad Revolution , was originally conceived as \u201c litigation symptoms \u201d by physicians hired to consult with rail companies in the US and Europe in the early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original \u201c tobacco science \u201d was actually \u201c railroad science.\n\u201d These medico-legal consultants proposed that the condition was triggered by \u201c fear of technological progress \u201d and the theory was used successfully to beat back a growing number of passenger and crew injury claims for \u201c railway spine , \u201d aka , whiplash , which didn \u2019 t exist in clinical literature until the advent of high-speed travel .\nThe condition wasn \u2019 t regarded as an overwhelmingly feminine diagnosis until Jean-Martin Charcot , widely regarded as the father of modern neurology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French national railway , blended psychogenic hysteria with a metaphorically Platonic gynecological hypotheses ( Plato believed the uterus wandered around women \u2019 s bodies , strangling and inhibiting various physical processes ) .\nRegarding railway spine , Charcot opined , \u201c a pecular mental condition is often developed which is intimately connected in my judgment with the hypnotic state.\n\u201d And medico-legal tort defense seems to be a peculiar condition of paid consultants .\nHysteria is also another example of a persistent credibility shield wandering around various clinical fields and strangling advancement .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms exist in clinical literature ( medical students \u2019 disease for example ) , the diagnosis has also been extended haphazardly to any condition that science could not ( or would not ) explain even as many past clinical foundations crumble in its wake .\nAnd so \u201c hysteria \u201d is continuously reborn as a means of jujitsuing industrial injury claims and retains an overwhelmingly feminine patina .\nIt \u2019 s also viewed as \u201c contagious , \u201d \u201c largely genetic \u201d and like a \u201c virus.\n\u201d But none of these labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to define a designated and obviously political target in \u201c objective \u201d scientific terms according to Arendt : \u201c The introduction of the notion of \u2018 objective enemy \u2019 is much more decisive for the functioning of totalitarian regimes than the ideological definition of the respective categories.\n\u201d Conceptualized virulance under Stalin was more dependent on ideological castes than race , taking the form of the Lamarckian genetic view that Todorov refers to and that was favored by the most violent Jacobin factions during the French revolutionary Reign of Terror\u2014the idea that thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infect entire clans , classes and ethnic divisions with destructive ideology , warranting collective punishment and mass extermination .\n20th century Spanish dictator Francisco Franco \u2019 s chief psychiatrist Antonio Villejo-N\u00e1jera blended Nazi and Lamarckian eugenics and added a Freudian twist proposing that maternal hysteria could optimize and spread the genetic expression of the politically psychopathic \u201c red gene , \u201d a theory used to justify removal of an estimated 300,000 children from suspected Republican sympathizers , bizarre medical experimentation and mass slaughter .\nThe Villejo-N\u00e1jera viral genetic ideology model was adopted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terror in the mid to late 20th century , leading to hundreds of thousands of disappearances as well as stolen children .\nIn When Atheism Becomes Religion : America \u2019 s New Fundamentalists , former New York Times journalist Chris Hedges analyzes the pseudo-ideological movement of apologists for atrocity , torture and preemptive war led by Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris\u2014figureheads of the Skeptic corporate PR front organization leading the charge of biotech defense\u2014Hedges frames this viral conception of humanity as the underpinning of violent utopianism : \u201c The belief that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can advance morally , is itself an evil .\nIt provides a cover for criminality and abuse , a justification for murder\u2026 It reduces human beings to the status of a virus.\n\u201d And , again , whenever that happens , it \u2019 s political .\nProbably the best litmus to determine whether a source has a panoptic upshot is how many times the terms \u201c viral \u201d or \u201c contagion \u201d are used as metaphors for human beings or ideas .\nThe orgy of disease themes and metaphors in today \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual Ouroborus\u2014a snake swallowing its tail and regurgitating itself in an endless , unstoppable cycle , flipping back and forth between fears of literal and conceptual contagion to rationalize repressive policy .\nFor that purpose ,

Democracy , Dictatorship and All Your Most Cherished Beliefs .\nThe article concludes that managing disease is the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult of state science or \u201c scientism \u201d is the ultimate earmark of 20 th century totalitarianism , it \u2019 s a cult founded in analogies that grew \u201c fungus-like \u201d from the discovery of infectious pathogens .\nIt \u2019 s a form of tribalism that represents itself with a totem of the viral theory of politics and the orgy of disease metaphors arising from the militarization of science , including the disastrous view of human beings , other cultures and ideas as forms of \u201c contagion \u201d that must be \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you , luminous and terrifying , like a flash of lightning in a serene sky : ` Exterminate all the brutes ! '\nRandy Thornhill , the evolutionary psychologist who coined the germ theory of democracy , also authored a related theory arguing that societal violence ties directly to the prevalence of disease , therefore implying that social engineering through public health interventions may pave the way to a less violent future for mankind .\nIf the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame more than a decade ago after co-authoring The Natural History of Rape : Biological Bases for Sexual Coercion , in which authors recommend that women stop dressing provocatively in order to avoid men \u2019 s inherant evolutionary impulses to commit sexual assault .\nApparently Thornhill \u2019 s contagion theory of violence encompasses every form of aggression except rape , since he also once theorized that the individuals who are the most disease-resistant tend to be the most sexually attractive , implying that rates of rape would only increase in societies which more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s brave new disease-resistant utopia , all women might have to take to the veil to defend themselves against the one violent impulse that survives the public health revolution .\nThornhill \u2019 s pathogen theory of violence falls apart further when considering how wars of aggression can be waged by societies with relatively low communicable disease rates , not to mention how these wars spread both disease and further violence .\nAn obvious illustration of this is the US invasions of Iraq\u2014a case of a developed country with a lower domestic communicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far higher disease mortality .\nIn the Desert Shield/Desert Storm period , an estimated 1.7 million deaths , half among children from diseases including cholera and diarrheal illness , were largely caused by embargoed water purification chemicals ( a deliberate strategy according to leaked documents ) .\nThen the more recent war in Iraq and the war on terror have led to an estimated 1.3 million deaths and have conceivably triggered blowback in the form of ISIS , a militant movement that multiple political analysts have called the \u201c Frankenstein \u201d of Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether an advanced public health system has actually created a healthier society considering the predicted reversal of American longevity and the fact that infant mortality in the US is the worst in the developed world .\nMaybe Thornhill is suggesting that western war profiteers are immune compromised .\nThis leads back to the main problem with Thornhill \u2019 s theory that public health measures to control disease promote democracy .\nEven if the theory had some basis in fact , schemes based on it would still fail the reality test .\nIf the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal to spread the healthy state of democracy , it \u2019 s been mostly quackery and malpractice .\nAs the Monaco letter illustrates , a state \u2019 s officially stated aims of spreading democracy and individualism frequently don \u2019 t conform with actual agendas or end results involved with supposedly democratizing interventions .\nIt presupposes that the US is even a democracy at this point , when researchers from Princeton recently concluded that we are now an oligopoly and pointed out the obvious problem this poses for \u201c spreading democracy \u201d : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d was President Woodrow Wilson \u2019 s rationale for World War I , and it has been used to justify American military intervention ever since .\nCan we justify sending troops into other countries to spread a political system we can not maintain at home ?\nThe failed reality test of social engineering via disease management is a place where more literal and starry-eyed germ theories in social science like Randy Thornhill \u2019 s interplay with more proverbial viral theory of political ideology and panoticism , each serving as a potential Trojan horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of panopticism somewhat neutrally and , for better or worse , as an inevitable component of civilized culture .\nFoucault \u2019 s moral relativism on the issue might explain how the social theorist eventually became publicly sympathetic to neoliberalism that , ironically , happens to find its best points of entry in what are definably panoptic disaster-and-rescue scenarios ( as Naomi Klein documents , Iraq War leading to Shell and BP \u2019 s claim of Iraq \u2019 s oil reserves , post-Katrina sale of public housing , hospitals and schools to private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political analyst and linguist Noam Chomsky , who debated Foucault on human nature and the nature of power in 1971 , there \u2019 s nothing morally ambiguous about the viral concept of political ideology and how it relates to the authoritarian view of threats to state security that were purposefully characterized by Henry Kissinger as a \u201c contagion \u201d in order to justify wars of aggression .\nIn Kissinger \u2019 s analysis , a politically contagious threat is the development of independent nationalism in other countries that somehow presents either ideological or economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of , as Dr. Chomsky also put it , \u201c securing state power from the domestic population and securing concentrated private power \u201d : To borrow Henry Kissinger \u2019 s terminology , independent nationalism is a \u201c virus \u201d that might \u201c spread contagion.\n\u201d Kissinger was referring to Salvador Allende \u2019 s Chile .\nThe virus was the idea that there might be a parliamentary path towards some kind of socialist democracy .\nThe way to deal with such a threat is to destroy the virus and to inoculate those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderous national security states .\nThat was achieved in the case of Chile , but it is important to recognize that the thinking holds worldwide .\nIt was , for example , the reasoning behind the decision to oppose Vietnamese nationalism in the early 1950s and support France \u2019 s effort to reconquer its former colony .\nIt was feared that independent Vietnamese nationalism might be a virus that would spread contagion to the surrounding regions , including resource-rich Indonesia .\nThat might even have led Japan \u2014 called the \u201c superdomino \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the industrial and commercial center of an independent new order of the kind imperial Japan had so recently fought to establish .\nThat , in turn , would have meant that the U.S. had lost the Pacific war , not an option to be considered in 1950 .\nThe remedy was clear \u2014 and largely achieved .\nVietnam was virtually destroyed and ringed by military dictatorships that kept the \u201c virus \u201d from spreading contagion .\nUp until Edward Snowden \u2019 s divulgences in 2013 that the NSA has been domestically engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at least an illusion of relative freedom compared to the many countries that have been \u201c inoculated \u201d against democratically elected leadership in the transnational corporate push for globalization and US expansionism for resources .\nBut as further Snowden leaks illustrate , terrorist watchlisting has expanded to include assorted domestic and foreign nonviolent activists and political groups , aiming the panoptic lens squarely at citizens and civil rights activists .\nAmericans and their own \u201c nationalist \u201d conceptions of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms are treated as enemies and monitored as potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we \u2019 ve become the disease and , for that analogy , the NSA is the Center for Ideological Disease Control .\nAs Wikileaks \u2019 Julian Assange describes it , the surveillance agency is a \u201c state within a state \u201d comprised of 6 million individuals , a shocking proportion of whom\u2014reportedly 1.4 million , a third of them contractors for private corporations with overlapping ties to some of the world \u2019 s worst industrial offenders\u2014with Snowden-level security clearance .\nThe \u201c security state \u201d has a population larger than Denmark .\nIt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the privacy of average citizen and plausibly hostile to consumer activists .\nAnd the snooping and surveillance once presumably reserved for foreign foes appears to be one of the US \u2019 s current remedies to guard against domestic ideological shifts\u2014i.e.\n, activism\u2014 that threaten institutional and corporate power .\nIn fact , another leak by Snowden showed that , nine times out of ten , ordinary people\u2014about half American citizens\u2014 have been the subject of mass email collection rather than actual foreign targets .\nThe advantage of a conceptional and not literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incursions on rights and privacy never ends .\nBut a cover of managing actual contagion would still appear to be the most effective means to instill a state of plague .\nAs the interrupted vaccine series in Neptune Spear illustrated , the fact that children \u2019 s health was not apparently the central point of certain philanthropic campaigns has merely heightened suspicion of western intent around the world because the suspicion was already long-standing .\nIn Joseph Conrad \u2019 s The Heart of Darkness , \u201c enlightened \u201d and \u201c progressive \u201d European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress \u201d for curing so-called savagery in the Congo are a panoptic cover for \u201c rapacious greed , exploitation and barbarity , \u201d as journalist Chris Hedges summarized .\nIn the Western \u201c scramble for Africa \u201d which took place in the late 19th and early 20th century , the cure was far worse than the supposed ailment , leading to the first genocide of the 20th century , one that would be followed by many others .\nPanoticism is even more literally applied in Apocalypse Now , Francis Ford Coppola \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s story in Vietnam , the film illustrates the US mission to \u201c inoculate \u201d the region against communism and independent nationalism , and Captain Willard \u2019 s individual mission to quarantine Colonel Kurtz \u2019 s contagious psychopathic excesses .\nThe panoptic disease-as-Trojan-horse-for-occupation model is illustrated blatantly in the film when Colonel Kurtz \u2019 s pinpoints the particular moment he went mad\u2014 the time he served in Special Forces and was providing vaccinations to children in a village camp in Vietnam .\nKurtz : Horror has a face ... and you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moral terror are your friends .\nIf they are not , then they are enemies to be feared .\nThey are truly enemies !\nI remember when I was with Special Forces ... seems a thousand centuries ago .\nWe went into a camp to inoculate some children .\nWe left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio , and this old man came running after us and he was crying .\nHe could n't see .\nWe went back there , and they had come and hacked off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pile .\nA pile of little arms .\nAnd I remember ...\nI ...\nI ...\nI cried , I wept like some grandmother .\nI wanted to tear my teeth out ; I did n't know what I wanted to do !\nAnd I want to remember it .\nI never want to forget it ...\nI never want to forget .\nAnd then I realized ... like I was shot ... like I was shot with a diamond ... a diamond bullet right through my forehead .\nAnd I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that !\nThe genius !\nThe will to do that !\nPerfect , genuine , complete , crystalline , pure .\nAnd then I realized they were stronger than we , because they could stand that these were not monsters , these were men ... trained cadres .\nThese men who fought with their hearts , who had families , who had children , who were filled with love ... but they had the strength ... the strength ... to do that .\nIf I had ten divisions of those men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly .\nYou have to have men who are moral ... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling ... without passion ... without judgment ... without judgment !\nBecause it 's judgment that defeats us .\nBecause of the nature of US Army Special Forces\u2014which have been engaged for unconventional warfare and psychological operations since 1952 , often to covertly train and lead guerillas in occupied countries\u2014Kurtz \u2019 s speech in Coppola \u2019 s retelling implies the vaccine campaign was part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apparently based on several real life military figures and the film \u2019 s vaccination vignette was apparently borrowed directly from the experience of a gungho Vietnam veteran named Fred Rexer .\nThe time frame of Kurtz \u2019 s enlistment with Special Forces in the film\u20141964\u2014 would explain use of an injectable Salk polio vaccine and Kurtz \u2019 s initial contact with the Montagnard tribe .\nThe real life historical model under which Kurtz \u2019 s vaccination campaign took place would have been something along the lines of the expansion of the \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam and extended into Cambodia .\nThe Buon Enao operation involved teams led by medical personnel from Special Forces cultivating various sects of the Montagnards\u2014the indigenous warriors depicted in Kurtz \u2019 s Cambodian camp in the film\u2014 to get them to declare for the South Vietnamese government and cooperate with US forces .\nIn Vietnam , this was done in part through a program to train village medics to work in projects intended to replace South Vietnamese government healthcare and assistance programs that had been discontinued due to conflicts with the Viet Cong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps \u201d for the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups ( CIDG ) or Montagnard guerrilla troops .\nIn short , the cover for Kurtz \u2019 s mission in the film\u2014 the Trojan horse of medical philanthropy in exchange for political conversion\u2014is blown and unleashes the merciless wrath of the enemy\u2014the amputation of children \u2019 s inoculated arms .\nMedicine was the key entry point for control , to turn a country against itself , and the violent act was a rejection of a ploy .\nAt some point , the real life Buon Enao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to official military history .\nIn the less \u201c official \u201d but still documented history of the war recounted by political analysts like Chomsky , disaster resulted from a schizophrenic American pretense of preparations for withdrawal coupled with secret escalation of the war , including the US enactment of a coup against the Diem regime after the regime threatened to make a truce with North Vietnam\u2014an unwelcome outcome since it would have ended the war without a US victory over the \u201c contagion \u201d of states in the region escaping Western influence .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darkness and Apocalypse Now ( \u201c Willard \u201d in the film or \u201c Marlow \u201d in the novel ) could be said to represent blind indoctrination struggling to retain civilized illusion .\nThis is exposed when Willard/Marlow initially can \u2019 t believe that a man of such learned credentials as Kurtz could become so \u201c savage.\n\u201d But Conrad \u2019 s overall thrust is that the very idea that level of savagery of any individual or group has anything to do with level of education is an artifact of the western cult of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its own advanced technological juju for morality .\nAs Elie Wiesel wrote in the foreword to Annas \u2019 and Grodin \u2019 s The Nazi Doctors and the Nuremberg Code : It is not only medicine and human experimentation which is called into question : The areas of scholarship , learning , education and culture must also be reexamined in the light of what happened .\nThat doctors participated in the planning , execution and justification of the concentration camp massacres is bad enough , but it went beyond medicine .\nLike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every area of spiritual , cultural , intellectual endeavor .\nThus , the meaning of what happened transcended its own immediate limits\u2026I couldn \u2019 t understand these men who had , after all , studied for 8,10,12 or 14 years in German universities , which then were the best on the Continent , if not in the world .\nWhy did their education not shield them from evil ?\nThis question haunted me .\nConrad seems to argue that , rather than being implanted from outside , any developing savagery in the well-bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character that are then nurtured to psychopathic extremes in the darkness of self deception .\nThe self deception in Kurtz \u2019 s case\u2014the same that \u2019 s exposed in Willard \u2019 s/Marlow \u2019 s\u2014is that they have come to help .\nIn the end , both Marlow and Willard wearily recognize that Kurtz \u2019 s death was necessary to remove a threat against western mythology , not because Kurz was in any way a genuine anomaly to the West \u2019 s \u201c jolly pioneers of progress.\n\u201d What drives Kurtz mad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking glimpse in the mirror .\nKurtz \u2019 s heart is initially broken because he enters the jungle filled with noble ideals as the \u201c emissary of pity , and science , and progress.\n\u201d He had begun to believe in the civilizing cure of western magic\u2014the Trojan horse he had brought to confound the intended targets .\nWhen the intent is seen through and the offering rejected in the most blunt way , rather than rethinking the cause and shedding his paternalist delusions , he snaps and simply adjusts his delusions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater loyalty to the cause and fully transforms into the genocidal Second Coming of the technological Apocalypse .\nIn the final analysis , Kurtz has not \u201c gone native \u201d but is simply struck with the diabolical \u201c diamond bullet \u201d of a scheme to more quickly advance Western ends : to engage the targets in their own extermination .\nHe concedes that this had always been the point .\nHe simply dispenses with the hypocrisy .\nThe declassification of the CIA \u2019 s Phoenix Assassination program which was officially launched in 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tens of thousands of civilians suspected of supporting the North Vietnamese regime lends credence to the entry in Kurtz \u2019 s taped diary in Apocalypse Now : What do you call it , when the assassins accuse the assassin ?\nThey lie .\nThey lie and we have to be merciful , for those who lie .\nThose nabobs .\nI hate them .\nI really hate them . ''\nA \u201c nabob \u201d is a mogul or a Westerner who enriches themselves through foreign expedition .\nWillard , the film \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same cynicism towards his commanders \u2019 hypocrisy : It was a way we had over here of living with ourselves .\nWe 'd cut them in half with a machine gun and give them a Band-Aid .\nIt was a lie .\nAnd the more I saw of them , the more I hated liars .\nThose boys were never gon na look at me the same way again , but I felt like I knew one or two things about Kurtz that were n't in the dossier .\nWhat is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perfectly representative emissary of civilization , albeit one stripped of humanitarian cover .\nPart 5 looks into some of the combined stakes of the Gates Foundation \u2019 s emissaries of progress ,

Jeremy Scahill wrote in Huffington Post , Scooter Libby , with the help of the NY Times WMD spin-planting columnist Judy Miller , lobbied to make disease outbreaks instrumental to war footing .\nAt

able to incorporate reader insights along the way .\nSeveral comments to Part 2 addressed the above question\u2014whether globalization schemes exemplified by Bill Gates and his \u201c emissaries of pity , science and progress , \u201d panoptic control of the media and use of disease eradication as a fulcrum are driven by an identifiable ideology that is somehow equivalent , as argued in Part 3 , to \u201c scientism , \u201d the secular \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century totalitarianism .\nIf anything , certain comments illustrate how being caught directly in the crosshairs of looming political repression can make even the most dry , dark and creepy discourse in political philosophy suddenly accessible or even hopeful , if only because someone in the past bothered to write about the problem and had the relative liberty to do it.This means that history wanes , so perhaps the current campaign against civil and consumer rights , freedom of the press and privacy might too .\nBut to some observers , threats against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been .\nAlso discussed in Part 3 were the various forms of totalitarianism to choose from\u2014right , left , or the \u201c inverted \u201d variety currently taking hold in the US according to political philosopher Sheldon Wolin , who compared the present form to East Germany .\nIn a review of Wolin \u2019 s Democracy Incorporated , journalist Chris Hedges , who had been stationed in the GDR before the fall of the Berlin Wall , describes inverted totalitarianism as a system with interchangeable figureheads more prone to \u201c break souls \u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical forms of totalitarianism , which revolve around a demagogue or charismatic leader ; it finds its expression in the anonymity of the corporate state .\nThe corporate forces behind inverted totalitarianism do not , as classical totalitarian movements do , replace decaying structures with new structures .\nThey instead purport to honor electoral politics , freedom of expression and the press , the right to privacy and the guarantees of law .\nBut they so corrupt and manipulate electoral politics , the courts , the press and the essential levers of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses impossible .\nThe U.S. Constitution has not been rewritten , but steadily emasculated through radical judicial and legislative interpretation .\nWe have been left with a fictitious shell of democracy and a totalitarian core .\nAnd the anchor of this corporate totalitarianism is the unchecked power of our systems of internal security .\nIn light of the current astroturf campaign to remove medical rights , jail dissenters , etc.\n, much of it eminating from Gates-controlled media , the issue is certainly ripe for a clot of fascist and Bolshevic metaphors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical comparison for Gates : \u201c Bill Gates operates much as the conquistadors of the Spanish empire did ; no plan , no depth of purpose , fully backed by and fully in service to empire , and genocidal when necessary.\n\u201d What the comment highlights is that , in many environmental activism arenas , it \u2019 s no longer debated whether Bill Gates and his foundation do harm , simply whether it \u2019 s intentional or by design .\nEinstein reportedly wrote , \u201c Never attribute to malice that which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule out malice.\n\u201d Presuming Gates intended to cause over 47,000 cases of vaccine-induced flaccid paralysis to thin out the third world may be giving him and his foundation too much credit for competence .\nThe collateral might simply be a side effect of using a particularly cheap and dangerous technology as the means to unstated ends .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t imply Gates and his foundation have not engaged in other unethical and deliberate acts and that the real reason for employing brutal and undemocratic means to those ends are necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part 2 , in view of the Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s admission that vaccine drives have been repeatedly used as a cover for intelligence operations , it \u2019 s become apparent that American medical philanthropy exemplified by Gates has not always been about improving health in foreign populations .\nIn some cases , these campaigns may simply have been a classic manner of gathering intelligence and capturing health infrastructure in certain oil- , gas- or mineral-rich target nations as a militarized Trojan horse operation to gain control of resources\u2014 a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact revese of \u201c spreading democracy.\n\u201d For example , in the wake of the Afridi-CIA scandal surrounding the Bin Laden mission which was covered by Glenn Greenwald , a Western response to counter the resulting vaccine resistance was orchestrated with cooperating clerics throughout Islamic countries to issue \u201c fatwas \u201d to local populations to comply with vaccination .\nAny use of force that may have been employed to coerce this compliance , such as cases of vaccination at gunpoint in Malawi and other countries in Africa , has generally been downplayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatwa \u201d in Arabic is an enforceable legal edict .\nIn cases of coerced vaccination in Africa prior to Neptune Spear , it was not the imams but government , NGOs and the UN that provided the live oral polio vaccine according to Ugandan journalist , Kihura Nkuba .\nNkuba argued that those protesting the inoculation drive were not \u201c anti-vaccine \u201d but simply wanted the safer version of the polio inoculation that Western children receive : when Ugandans learned that it would be too expensive for UNICEF to provide the safer inactivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , many objected\u2014particularly families of HIV infected children for whom exposure to those who \u2019 ve received the live preparation is contraindicated .\nNkuba stated on C-Span , [ T ] he people said 'Okay , if it 's too expensive , we do n't want the cheap one .\nWe think at least we are worth five dollars or ten dollars , or something like this .\nSo if you ca n't bring the [ inactivated polio vaccine ] , we are not going to have the [ live virus ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they did .\nBut the government was ready for them - not really the government - the minister of health , the World Health Organization and the UNICEF .\nThey mobilized the army , and the police and moved from house to house .\nThey had asked the local authorities to do a list of people who had children , so they moved from house to house grabbing children at gunpoint and vaccinating them .\nThere \u2019 s a side controversy within this particular debate : that the safer , killed-virus form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less effective than the live preparation ( OPV ) \u2014 the reason , aside from cost differential , given for hesitations to adopt it in regions where polio is still active\u2014the irony being that IPV is ineffective in warding off vaccine-strain polio infections caused by OPV .\nIf the latter is the case , it would undermine justifications for US mandates that often uses the effectiveness of IPV as a pitch , making it unsurprising that Western media seldom mentions the issue .\nNkuba \u2019 s account shows that those resisting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least some residual faith in public health by requesting what they believed\u2014and what Americans are led to believe\u2014is the safer , yet still effective form of inoculation .\nThe account also undermines the idea that vaccine resistance in the developing and developed world exists only due to false assumptions and anti-science superstition as the Gates Foundation repeatedly claims : \u201c Because barriers to some of the goals we \u2019 re pursuing include superstition [ emphasis Gates Foundation \u2019 s ] \u2013 barriers built on various assumptions about morality , cultural traditions , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing\u2014must be helped to understand that the programs we advocate save lives and improve health\u2026 \u201d As reported in the Express Tribune , a senior Taliban Commander in the North Waziristan Agency of Pakistan published and distributed a pamphlet describing suspicion of vaccine drives as more than an assumption .\nThe pamphlet stated that \u201c Polio infects one child in a million , but hundreds of Waziri women , children and elders have been killed in these strikes \u201d and that constant surveillance in the region was causing mental breakdowns among residents : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients increases in Waziristan , which is worse than Polio.\n\u201d Regardless of whether the source of resistance is among sworn enemies of the US or not , and regardless of whether resistors have a perfect understanding of vaccine effectiveness or command of disease epidemiology , it \u2019 s still true that the live polio preparation is known to spread the disease and still true that hundreds of children and civilians ( and apparently US citizens ) have died in US drone strikes\u2014therefore explanations for resistance should not be dismissed .\nRather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vaccination coverage , it would seem more rational if global public health authorities had openly tried to solve the dillema and improve the technology .\nBut once drives were tied to drones , the pointless ( to health ) trajectory of force simply snowballed .\nIn Pakistan , current military operations are seen as the \u201c best chance in years \u201d to overcome resistance to the live oral polio vaccine , leading to the detention of over 500 parents : Military operation gives officials the best chance in years for polio teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police commissioner says ... \u201d We had 13,000 to 16,000 refusal cases , ' the deputy police commissioner for Peshawar , Riaz Khan Mahsud , said in an interview .\n'There is total determination on our part .\nWe shall convince parents of the good of vaccinating their children , but if they refuse , we shall detain them .\nThere is no leniency\u2026 You have to resort to coercive measures when persuasion fails.\n\u201d Since the Gates Foundation specializes in precisely this type of local interface to address vaccine resistance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it \u2019 s reasonable to suspect that the foundation plays some role in engaging foreign governments in not just the implementation of vaccination but its enforcement .\nThe Foundation has generally relied on coercive or chaotic regimes for just this purpose as was the case in Chad , when children were forced to take the experimental MenAfriVac as part of a Gates-sponsored program .\nAccording to reports from Gouru , up to 50 of these children developed severe side effects , convulsions and paralysis .\nFor another example , the Gates Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HPV vaccine campaign in India and Columbia that improperly drew consent in the poorest provinces , resulting in deaths and injuries to scores of young girls .\nIn the period following the reported use of vaccine drives as reported cover for drone missions and the Neptune Spear vaccination fiasco , efforts to counter resistance could have been motivated either to preserve the noble mission of disease eradication or to preserve the effectivness of using vaccine philanthropy as military mission cover\u2014or a blend of both .\nThe difficulty of interpreting intent is the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson Tasnim Aslam cited the common understanding that the World Health Organization \u2019 s participation in the fake shot campaign portion of the operation to kill Bin Laden\u2014a claim that the United Nations and World Health Organization have denied .\nThe UN \u2019 s denial was somewhat unconvincing due to the WHO \u2019 s involvement with the Global Vaccine Action Plan ( GVAP ) which paved the way for the operation in many senses .\nWith the UN \u2019 s backing , the GVAP lobbies various governments worldwide to increase of global vaccinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occupy Corporatism , the WHO has planned campaigns in over 190 countries in collaboration with Decade of Vaccine Collaboration ( DVC ) , which includes stakeholders from the global health community .\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ( BMGF ) have also partnered with the WHO and DVC to support GVAP .\nGates \u2019 financial stakes in Africa alone are so vast and so intrinsically tied to philanthropic ventures that he may have been driven to a Kurtz-like moment\u2014 echoing his CNN claim that vaccine safety watchdogs \u201c kill children \u201d \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dambisa Moyo , author of New York Times bestseller Dead Aid .\nGates argued that the book \u201c promotes evil \u201d for making the charge that those who claim to be helping Africa are , in fact , doing enormous damage .\nAmong its more controversial theories on foreign aid to the continent , Moyo \u2019 s book documents the incontestable fact that this aid has largely enriched and empowered corrupt and oppressive governments against the interests of citizens and independent development in many countries .\nThe book is light on addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these corrupt leaders then become servants of Western interests , though the implications are obvious .\nIf Gates \u2019 defenders complain that Gates is the frequent subject of hyperbolic attacks , he himself has a hyperbolic pattern of lashing out only at those indictments that bear some degree of truth and threaten to bleed into the mainstream media .\nHe couldn \u2019 t possibly publicly beat back all the wilder and more obscure charges or he \u2019 d be blustering around the clock .\nFor instance , considering the revolving agendas and corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmeshed in , it \u2019 s understandable that both are often accused of even darker deeds , such as reports from a Nigerian Christian organization that Gates and Monsanto have been co-sponsoring Boko Haram to \u201c displace the indigenous farmers in the country and replace them with\u2026 corporate farms in the North East food basket region of Nigeria.\n\u201d If anything , buzz like the Gates/Monsanto/Boko Haram story gives a fever reading of the foundation \u2019 s reputation abroad .\nFurthermore , there \u2019 s that degree of truth again .\nA report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of US/Gates initiative to foist GM crops on African countries : JOHANNESBURG , SOUTH AFRICA , 23 February , 2015 \u2013 US agencies , funders such as the Gates Foundation , and agribusiness giant Monsanto are trying to force unwilling African nations to accept expensive and insufficiently tested Genetically Modified ( GM ) foods and crops , according to a new report released today .\n\u201c The US , the world 's top producer of GM crops , is seeking new markets for American GM crops in Africa .\nThe US administration 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce biosafety laws that promote agribusiness interests instead of protecting Africans from the potential threats of GM crops , \u201d said Haidee Swanby from the African Centre for Biosafety , which authored the report commissioned by Friends of the Earth International .\nThe new report also exposes how agribusiness giant Monsanto influences biosafety legislation in African countries , gains regulatory approval for its product , and clears the path for products such as GM maize ( corn ) .\nIt \u2019 s also been verified that the process of paramilitary recruitment in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is currently associated with Monsanto .\nAs investigative reporter and Dirty Wars author Jeremy Scahill wrote for The Nation : Over the past several years , entities closely linked to the private security firm Blackwater have provided intelligence , training and security services to US and foreign governments as well as several multinational corporations , including Monsanto , Chevron , the Walt Disney Company , Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines and banking giants Deutsche Bank and Barclays , according to documents obtained by The Nation .\nBlackwater 's work for corporations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned by Blackwater 's owner and founder , Erik Prince : Total Intelligence Solutions and the Terrorism Research Center ( TRC ) .\nPrince is listed as the chairman of both companies in internal company documents , which show how the web of companies functions as a highly coordinated operation .\nOfficials from Total Intelligence , TRC and Blackwater ( which now calls itself Xe Services ) did not respond to numerous requests for comment for this article .\nOne of the most incendiary details in the documents is that Blackwater , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ `` intel arm '' of Monsanto , offering to provide operatives to infiltrate activist groups organizing against the multinational biotech firm .\nAnd there \u2019 s truth to the idea that Gates has a history of investing in corporations that enlist death squads .\nFor one example , the murders of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other environmentalists from the Ogoni region in Nigeria in 1995 have since commonly been identified as corporate \u201c hits \u201d by the Nigerian government at the behest of Shell Oil .\nBut this history didn \u2019 t stop Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the LA Times investigation on the human health toll of Bill Gates \u2019 oil holdings in Africa that ironically increased rates of death among children for the very diseases the foundation claims to prevent through vaccination , Gates began \u201c rethinking unethical investments \u201d \u2014at least in terms of public perceptions .\nBut through this time , Gates only continued to build other oil-related holdings that carry serious risks of human and environmental health hazards , such as his stake in Canada \u2019 s biggest railway company , Canadian National Railway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poorly maintained , mile-long freight trains that have a record of accidents and spills .\nAccording to investigations by The Nation \u2019 s Chares Piller , the foundation maintains investments in weapons manufacturers , Shell , BP , and the coal giant Rio Tinto and makes the point that , though the Gates foundation claims investments like the above are \u201c blind , \u201d how does such a blind foundation maintain humanitarian credentials , much less global authority on public health ?\nRio Tinto alone has quite a history , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Franco \u2019 s forces in its Spanish mines at Huelva where it was founded , to apartheid style discrimination and the practice of virtual slavery in Namibia in the 1970 \u2019 s , attacks on unionized workers in its current borax mine in California , engaging the government of Indonesia to suppress and kill labor and land activists in Papua , New Guinea , endless counts of spills , leaks and deliberate environmental damage and now its mining lease of a sacred Native American site .\nThe Lives and Ideas of Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain amount of truth to the reader \u2019 s \u201c conquistador \u201d analogy mentioned above : intentional and unintentional biowarfare , the militarized helping hand as cover for plunder and a vast trail of collateral .\nIt \u2019 s all there , though the comment also questions the existence of a driving \u201c doctrine of salvation \u201d or ideology other than profit .\nBut I might argue that if the motives that animate Gates are only as schizophrenic as , say , Columbus \u2019 s\u2014who wrote ceaselessly of finding gold and even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn \u2019 t rule out the question of reigning ideology .\nIn Conquest of America : The Question of the Other , French historian and political philosopher Tzvetan Todorov argues that Columbus\u2014who was so pious he wouldn \u2019 t sail on Sundays\u2014was overwhelmingly driven to ensure the \u201c universal victory of Christianity : Infinitely more than gold , the spread of Christianity is Columbus \u2019 heart \u2019 s desire , and he has set forth his feelings in the case very explicitly , notably in a letter to the pope\u2026This , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Our Lord to be able to propagate His holy name and His Gospel throughout the universe \u201d ( \u201c Letter to Pope Alexander VI , \u201d February 1502 ) .\nThe same was true of many that followed according to Todorov , along with an obsession that the new world represented the earthly paradise of the bible , casting the form of Christianity driving the conquests as cult-like by definition .\nThe utopian concept of an earthly paradise with the promise of earthly transcendence is a direct contradiction to Christ \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not of this world.\n\u201d The standard platform of any violent cult , whether religious or political , secular or non , is supported neither by the bible nor the theory of evolution : the promise of a future paradise on earth free of disease , violence , suffering and so forth and the appintment ( usually self-appointment ) of a transcendent elite who will lead us there .\nThis is because only such a bloated covanent could justify so many incursions on rights and privacy and so much killing and destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress .\nIt \u2019 s generally equivalent to the cult of science at the root of totalitariani doctrine .\nGates is like a hydraulic valve , who , when plugged into existing machinery , amplifies historical interpretations of current militarized schemes for globalization .\nHe \u2019 s only exemplary of any of it to the extent that the philanthropist and tech guru has never done anything original in his life but merely \u201c embraces and extends \u201d the ideas and operations of others .\nIn a 1998 interview with Techrights , Noam Chomsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public system \u201d in an argument that segues from practical monopolies ( profit schemes ) to political and social ( tyranny ) : So how does Microsoft achieve its enormous profits ?\nWell , Bill Gates is pretty frank about it .\nHe says they do it by `` embracing and extending '' the ideas of others .\nThey 're based on computers , for example .\nComputers were created at public expense and public initiative .\nIn the 1950s when they were being developed , it was about 100 % public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet .\nThe ideas , the initiatives , the software , the hardware -- these were created for about 30 years at public initiative and expense , and it 's just now being handed over to guys like Bill Gates\u2026It 's a form of tyranny .\nBut , that 's the whole point of corporatization \u2013 to try to remove the public from making decisions over their own fate , to limit the public arena , to control opinion , to make sure that the fundamental decisions that determine how the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , commerce , distribution , thought , social policy , foreign policy , everything\u2014are not in the hands of the public , but rather in the hands of highly concentrated private power .\nIn effect , tyranny unaccountable to the public .\nAny recognizable ideology underlying the foundation \u2019 s exploits has also simply been \u201c embraced and extended \u201d from existing sources\u2014precisely what makes it identifiable .\nAnd even if any identifiable ideology held by Gates amounts to nothing more than expedient rationalizations in service to profit and power , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to these schemes , if only because ideology and the lure of a grand plan focused on the betterment of the species and the planet would be the typical selling point to get others to participate and enable them to sleep at night despite the fallout .\nTodorov argues further in Hope and Memory and other publications that scientism is just one of three earmarks of totalitarianism , the others being the legislation of morality ( Todorov uses controversial examples , such as European legislation against hate speech , on the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech ) and \u201c instrumentalism \u201d \u2014the policy of doing something merely because you have the tools to do it ( i.e.\n, bombing Laos in 1968 because cessations of bombing in Vietnam left idle planes ; a doctor prescribing drugs because there are samples on hand , etc . )\nInstrumentalism also serves as an explanation of how atrocity can be committed by average people and illustrates the indispensible function of doctrine and ideology .\nFrom Todorov \u2019 s Facing the Extreme : Moral Life in Concentration Camps : [ T ] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict themselves in thought and deed to instrumentality and treat every action as if it were a means to something else rather than as an end in itself .\nIn the realm of material production , the fulfillment of that demand does not yield particularly brilliant results , as expanding bureaucracies and the loss of personal initiative present formidable obstacles .\nIn the domain of moral conduct , however , the demand is far more productive .\nThe question is often asked how `` ordinary people , '' `` decent husbands and fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nWhere was their conscience in all of this ?\nThe answer is by usurping social goals and restricting people to instrumentalist thinking , the totalitarian power manages to have its subjects accomplish whatever tasks they are assigned without its having to disturb the individual 's moral structure at all .\nGuards who committed atrocities never stopped distinguishing between good and evil .\nTheir moral faculty had not withered away .\nThey simply believed the atrocity was in fact a `` good thing , '' and thus not an atrocity at all -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards of good and evil -- told them so .\nThe guards were not deprived of a moral sensibility but provided with a new one .\nThe identification of scientism as a \u201c doctrine of salvation \u201d fueling conquest and suppression would only complete the conquistador analogy .\nIt \u2019 s not so different from East Germany after all .\nIt would also give the panoptic analogy\u2014that the Gates Foundation \u2019 s use of disease eradication as an in-road to \u201c securing state power from the domestic population and securing concentrated private power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves are treated as ideological and actual disease carriers\u2014 an identifiably totalitarian cast .\nThe fact that Gates is an apologist for mass surveillance doesn \u2019 t do much to change the impression .\nIn an interview for Rolling Stone , Gates argues that Americans must simply put their trust in the security state and relinquish rights to privacy : Q : When people think about the cloud , it 's not only the accessibility of information and their documents that comes to mind , but also their privacy \u2013 or lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras everywhere in outdoor streets ?\nMy personal view is having cameras in inner cities is a very good thing .\nIn the case of London , petty crime has gone down .\nThey catch terrorists because of it .\nAnd if something really bad happens , most of the time you can figure out who did it .\nThere 's a general view there that it 's not used to invade privacy in some way .\nYet in an American city , in order to take advantage of that in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this information is going to be used for .\nGates \u2019 involvement with the global vaccination campaign is not his only investment in the jolly march to progress , the list of which is dizzying and illustrates a sort of trajectory from profit-oriented strategies to social engineering .\nAside from oil and gas development , providing billions in Monsanto investments and profits in Africa and a variety of other investments in biotechnology , the Gates Foundation has provided key participation in the NSA \u2019 s domestic surveillance , has campaigned for and implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking of school children , has invested in private prisons , is the major donor to a foundation that generates policy and lobbies for legislation effecting child protective services practices and a major donor to public-private adoption corporations .\nAnother question asked in Part 1 is if there wasn \u2019 t an end game involved in the campaign against consumer rights .\nWhile consumers are damned if they do and damned if they don \u2019 t comply with an ever-growing number of required vaccinations within a system where industry has complete legal immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit either way\u2014whether the public goes along with it or whether chaos is unleashed , leading to mass opt-outs and resistance .\nIf Gates \u2019 investments in drug and vaccine makers , weapons , prison labor , private prisons and child protective services seem curiously well positioned to benefit in either scenario , this might be merely practical , not an expression of underlying ideology .\nBut the fact that it overlaps with one of the mainstays of authoritarian systems\u2014imprisoning people and grabbing their children , just a thing that totalitarian systems from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the GDR , etc.\n, engaged in as a potent form of social programming\u2014 seems significant , particularly due to the current rash of state child removals for trivial causes based on disagreement over medical doctrine or to penalize freedom of speech .\nIn reviewing Foucault \u2019 s panotic concept of the surveillance state , it \u2019 s also interesting to realize that Enlightenment philosopher Jeremy Bentham \u2019 s panoptic prison plan employing psychological fear and constraint through constant surveillance was once viewed as groundbreakingly humane .\nThese days , the panotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America in the mass data collection age and the fact that the US now boasts the highest rate of imprisonment of any country in the world , all a fulfillment of Bentham \u2019 s dream .\nAs political philosopher John Nicholas Gray points out in The Guardian , modern worshipers of the ideals of Englightenment such as bestselling author and neuroscientist Steven Pinker\u2014who argues the increasingly popular orthodoxy in The Better Angels of Our Nature that violent death has continually declined in the modern world ( while Gray demonstrates that it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the species is evolving to be more moral ( while Gray asserts that it is not ) \u2014 tend to gloss over Bentham \u2019 s contributions .\nThis is because any modern humanitarian appreciation of Bentham \u2019 s vision is only relative to the penal horrors of his time .\nIn reviewing Pinker \u2019 s book , Gray writes , [ Steven ] Pinker and [ Peter ] Singer belong in a contemporary orthodoxy .\nWith other beliefs crumbling , many seek to return to what they piously describe as \u201c Enlightenment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as unambiguously benign as is nowadays commonly supposed .\nJohn Locke denied America \u2019 s indigenous peoples any legal claim to the country \u2019 s \u201c wild woods and uncultivated wastes \u201d ; Voltaire promoted the \u201c pre-Adamite \u201d theory of human development according to which Jews were remnants of an earlier and inferior humanoid species ; Kant maintained that Africans were innately inclined to the practice of slavery ; the utilitarian Jeremy Bentham developed the project of an ideal penitentiary , the Panopticon , where inmates would be kept in solitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these views is discussed by Singer or Pinker .\nMore generally , there is no mention of the powerful illiberal current in Enlightenment thinking , expressed in the Jacobins and the Bolsheviks , which advocated and practised methodical violence as a means of improving society .\nInterestingly , Pinker is a speaker for the corporate and institutional PR front organization , the Skeptics , which promotes forced vaccination , as does Pinker himself\u2014 if it \u2019 s generally agreed that the removal of rights to refuse a policy is consistent with forcing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You would never know , from reading Pinker , that Nazi \u201c scientific racism \u201d was based in theories whose intellectual pedigree goes back to Enlightenment thinkers such as the prominent Victorian psychologist and eugenicist Francis Galton .\nSuch links between Enlightenment thinking and 20th-century barbarism are , for Pinker , merely aberrations , distortions of a pristine teaching that is innocent of any crime : the atrocities that have been carried out in its name come from misinterpreting the true gospel , or its corruption by alien influences .\nThe childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminiscent of Christians who ask how a religion of love could possibly be involved in the Inquisition .\nIn each case it is pointless to argue the point , since what is at stake is an article of faith .\nIn attempting to replace religion with a cult of science or scientism\u2014which Pinker unconvincingly denies is the point\u2014 the new Enlightenment , as Gray calls the optimistic movement , defines itself , since the campaign is dependent on making disease and all its metaphoric applications the opening wedge for a wide array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every dark aspect of Enlightenment it ignores .\nTo repeat key excerpts from Todorov \u2019 s Hope and Memory on the cult of science , [ I ] f the transparency of the real includes the human world , then there is nothing to stop us from imagining how to create the \u201c new man , \u201d a human species without the blemishes of the original strain .\nTotalitarianism isn \u2019 t totalitarianism without the ideological disease model whereby the enemy of the state , as Arendt argued , is seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a \u201c carrier of disease.\n\u201d But the first goal of Manichean constructs and secular doctrines of salvation isn \u2019 t the identification of an inherently criminal , inferior caste but to support the concept of an elite , superior caste .\nAnd all cults are founded on the hopeful-sounding conception that humans can evolve teleologically\u2014for the better\u2014in an ethical sense .\nBill Gates , an avowed fan of Pinker \u2019 s book , The Better Angels of Our Nature , writes , Pinker presents a tremendous amount of evidence that humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more humane .\nThe trend started thousands of years ago and has continued to this day .\nAs I 'm someone who \u2019 s fairly optimistic in general , the book struck a chord with me and got me to thinking about some of our foundation 's strategies .\nAnd there you have it .\nThe picture is complete even if the analogies are a hash .\nWhether Gates actually believes what he says or whether it \u2019 s just a selling point for conversion and drafting purposes , he \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleological-evolutionary-paradise-on-earth drivel at the core of scientism .\nJournalist Chris Hedges , also a lead plaintiff with Daniel Ellsberg and others in the suit against the Obama administration for the \u201c indefinite detention \u201d provision of the National Defense Authorization Act , honed in on this bastardized version of Darwinism presented by the organized corporate and institutional front group with which Pinker is affiliated , as the perfect expression of the new totalitarian cult of science , identifying in it echoes of the worst expression of the European Enlightenment\u2014 Galtonian and Spencerian ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin , unlike Spencer , was not a teleological utopian .\nThere was , for Darwin , no final goal .\nDarwin saw that species accrued mutations and adaptations that , over time , caused change\u2026 It was Spencer , not Darwin , who argued that , step by step we were progressing as a species and would end with the perfect human being .\nSocial Darwinism bears many similarties to religious fundamentalism .\nIt justifies the political , social and economic domination of those who are weaker and those who are poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than God who blesses the strong and the priveleged .\nBut the self delusion is the same .\nThe new atheists of the twenty-first century , while they do not endorse the hierarchy of races or espouse the crude racist doctrine of earlier Social Darwinists , continue to argue that natural selection is social selection .\nThey continue to create moral hiararchies among human beings and use these hierarchies to sanction violence .\nThey do this because they insist we are moving forard to a final good .\nThis is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolutionary biology .\nPart 6 of this series explores

apparently initiated by so-called pro-life ' groups , are completely untrue .\nThe vaccines do not contain contraceptive vaccines or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pregnancy and their labelling accurately describes their actual contents .\nThe false claims made by these groups have had an adverse impact on immunisation programmes in all four countries .\nAs it happens , the WHO had been attempting to squash rumors of abortifacient vaccines since 1995 .\nDamage to immunisation programmes from misinformation on contraceptive vaccines > Abstract '' There are serious suspicions of a conspiracy by the U.S.

ABUJA , Nigeria ( Reuters ) - Nigeria is to test samples of the polio vaccine next month in the hope of resolving a dispute with Muslim authorities which has helped spread the crippling disease to children across Africa .\nSince long before Operation Neptune Spear , the mainstream media\u2014 often citing sources associated with UNICEF , the WHO or the Gates Foundation \u2019 s vaccine surveillance program \u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread \u201c irrational fear \u201d of vaccination , such as the idea that vaccines can cause infertility .\nA 2004 report from Reuters : Gates \u2019 references to the dangers of overpopulation are not novel and are carefully scripted .\nBut again , it may be a litmus of Gates \u2019 and his foundation \u2019 s global reputation that many assume the various disasters that trail Gates \u2019 philanthropic and industrial schemes listed in Parts 2 and 5 are necessarily deliberate , thereby lending a sinister subtext to his population control statements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain of overpopulation on the survival of the planet and the delicate ecosystem in itself is not particularly evil or authoritarian .\nWhat would make it so is any argument that the end justifies any means at all and evidence that those ends were implemented using unethical means .\nReligious organizations have frequently accused Gates of diabolical extremes , specifically of advancing a eugenicist population control agenda .\nThe charge is usually based on hyperbolized statements Gates made at the mHealth Summit on the issue , most famously his suggestion that if families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing fewer children to disease , they might choose to have fewer in the first place : `` The key thing , the most important fact that people should know and make sure other people know : As you save children under 5 , that is the thing that reduces population growth\u2026That sounds paradoxical .\nThe fact is that within a decade of improving health outcomes , parents decide to have less children . ''\nLoyal to the Nightmare : The Vatican Squares off with Gates and the World Health Organization Over Mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Corporatism Since the BBC report followed WHO research on this precise type of abortifacient vaccine , it was already known that the combination of tetanus toxoid and HCG could cause permanent sterility : Results of studies on birth control vaccines accomplished by many research groups within the WHO Special Programme of Research , Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction has been reviewed .\nThe mostly investigated contraceptive vaccines contain human chorionic gonadotropin , and therefore structure , biological role and immunogenicity of the hormone were presented .\nAlso , vaccines obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human chorionic gonadotropin , its heterodimer with subunit beta of ovine lutropin or C-terminal peptide of beta subunit were described .\nResults of two phases of clinical trials with immuno-contraceptive vaccines were presented .\nThe use of contraceptive vaccines for treatment of some trophoblastic tumors and the idea of using contraceptive recombinant vaccines were also mentioned .\nIn October , 2014 , the same accusation that the WHO and various organizations were performing mass sterilization through vaccination drives was leveled again , this time in a statement by theKenya Conference of Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not convinced that the government has taken adequate responsibility to ensure that Tetanus Toxoid vaccine ( TT ) laced with Beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( b-HCG ) sub unit is not being used by the sponsoring development partners .\nThis has previously been used by the same partners in Philippines , Nicaragua and Mexico to vaccinate women against future pregnancy .\nBeta HCG sub unit is a hormone necessary for pregnancy .\nWhen injected as a vaccine to a non-pregnant woman , this Beta HCG sub unit combined with tetanus toxoid develops antibodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman \u2019 s egg becomes fertilized , her own natural HCG will be destroyed rendering her permanently infertile .\nIn this situation tetanus vaccination has been used as a birth control method .\nWe retain that the tetanus vaccination campaign bears the hallmarks of the programmes that were carried out in Philippines , Mexico and Nicaragua .\nWe would want to participate in ensuring that the vaccines to be administered are free of this hormone .\nThe Washington Post reported on the story on November 11th , 2014 : NAIROBI , Kenya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the government over a tetanus vaccine aimed at women in their childbearing years has clergy urging people to shun the injection , saying it \u2019 s a stealth population-control ploy .\nOn Tuesday ( Nov.11 ) , the bishops appearing before the parliamentary health committee said they had tested the vaccine privately and were shocked to find it was laced with a birth control hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin .\n\u201c We are calling on all Kenyans to avoid the tetanus vaccination campaign because we are convinced it is indeed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Paul Kariuki , chairman of the Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops \u2019 health committee .\nThe tangle began in March , when bishops became suspicious about the vaccine , which was targeted at women in the reproductive ages of 14 to 49 , and excluded boys and men .\nMore recently , as reported by Lawrence Solomon , Vatican Radio has issued a response : Catholic Bishops in Kenya have been opposed to the nationwide Tetanus Vaccination Campaign targeting 2.3 million Kenyan women and girls of reproductive age between 15-49 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sterilize women and control population growth , \u201d In case anyone was to argue that the Kenyan Bishops association , as a religious entity , is necessarily \u201c anti-science , \u201d Solomon points out that the Kenyan Catholic Medical Association has been implementing vaccination for over 100 years .\nBut it \u2019 s not as if one needs to be Catholic or even religious to think that sterilizing human beings against their will , in particular targeting black and brown and the poor , qualifies as a human rights violation .\nAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation is the primary donor and organizer of many third world vaccination drives .\nThe GAVI Alliance , which \u201c brings together developing country and donor governments , the World Health Organization , UNICEF , the World Bank , the vaccine industry in both industrialized and developing countries , research and technical agencies , civil society , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other private philanthropists , \u201d was the major donor for the Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus Elimination Initiative across Africa and the major donor to the Kenyan Health Sector Partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In terms of baseline financing , Government of Kenya ( GoK ) contributed 37 % .\nThe GAVI alliance contributed to 46 % of the cost and this was due to the cost of new vaccines .\nOther partners contributed 17 % of the cost .\nThe Government fully financed all the traditional vaccines and personnel cost associated with giving immunization .\nGAVI finance was used in procurement of new and under used vaccines and injection supplies .\nOther partner contributions were utilized in the financing of supplementary immunization activities and surveillance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions is shown in Figure 11 below .\nThe \u201c partnership \u201d ( which the Kenyan Catholic medical committee protested being excluded from ) likely includes those listed in the table : GAVI , WHO , UNICEF and USAID .\nAccording to investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill , USAID , the United States Agency for International Development , has long been regarded as a front for the CIA : USAID is part of the system feeding intelligence back to entities like the CIA , the NSA and others , that have to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy\u2014you know , USAID has a long history of working as a front for the CIA , of course , but , you know , this part of it wasn \u2019 t known .\nAnd USAID confirmed to us that they do in fact participate in this program .\nAgain , in light of the use of vaccination as cover for the 2011 mission to kill Bin Laden , when news came out in 2013 that the British spy agency GCHQ and the NSA had been spying on UNICEF , this might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards a faultless UN organization .\nBut there \u2019 s another way to view this : the spying could also constitute oversight of an investment\u2014something akin to corporations snooping on their own employees .\nThe same combined investigation that listed NSA surveillance of UNICEF operations performed by The Guardian , the New York Times and Der Spiegel reported that strategic US allies , including Germany\u2014 a country that hosts a critical drone control center in Ramstein\u2014has also been a surveillance target .\nSpying on Germany could be viewed as \u201c oversight \u201d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s still unknown whether UNICEF or any other Western organization or NGO like Gates \u2019 GAVI participated in arranging the CIA \u2019 s and Dr. Shakil Afridi \u2019 s vaccination drive , though Afridi conceivably had contact with these organizations as medical chief of Khyber , a Federally Administrated Tribal Area in Pakistan where UNICEF has repeatedly been active .\nOne of the polio clinics attacked by the Taliban in the wake of the Afridi scandal was in Khyber after all .\nBut the view of UNICEF as a possible military intelligence \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Neptune Spear fiasco alone\u2014more on the fact that UNICEF \u2019 s pure and noble veneer hasn \u2019 t always been stainless and , through the UN , may be vulnerable to corporate influence .\nIt \u2019 s interesting that the Bill , Hilary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation donated at least 1 % to the overall Kenyan vaccination campaign , though the Clinton Foundation would not have been entangled in the reportedly similar abortifacient tetanus vaccination drives in the Philippines and Nicaragua which Kenyan bishops referred to , since the foundation did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also be evil , aside from the reasoning that any means at all justify the goal of population reduction , would be the cynical use of this campaign to target particular populations .\nManipulation of reports to prove that overpopulation represents a prime threat to survival of the planet\u2014when not all agree this is the case\u2014to serve an agenda of targeting particular populations would also be evil , especially if the ulterior agenda is to reduce particular populations that pose tactical and ideological threats to corporate interests .\nAnd this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of politics discussed in Part 4 ( and the many ways it \u2019 s applied to human beings discussed in Part 3 ) meshes with Gates and the WHO \u2019 s population control campaign .\nAs with Gates \u2019 detractors , though some of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \u2019 s critics may hyperbolize or paraphrase some of his public statements to generate more sensational soundbites , there \u2019 s a raging fire beyond the smoke of rumor and buzz .\nThe problem with using direct quotes from Kissinger is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State \u2019 s bureaucratic language doesn \u2019 t usually lend itself to sensationalism , however much his actual statements may mean the same thing as the paraphrasing .\nTake for example Kissinger \u2019 s now-declassified National Security Study Memorandum ( \u201c NSSM 200 \u201d ) : Implications of Worldwide Population Growth For U.S. Security and Overseas Interests , dated December 10 , 1974 .\nPerforming a kind of Colonel Kurtz exercise of surgically removing Kissinger \u2019 s hypocritical noble cover of humanitarian concern for the wellbeing of citizens of oil and mineral-rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the document tell a certain story and shed light on current events : \u2022 \u201c Rapid population growth is not in itself a major factor in pressure on depletable resources ( fossil fuels and other minerals ) , since demand for them depends more on levels of industrial output than on numbers of people\u2026 \u201d \u2022 \u201c the U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad , especially from less developed countries .\nThat fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political , economic , and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability , population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the United States\u2026 \u201d \u2022 \u201c the world is increasingly dependent on mineral supplies from developing countries\u2026 \u201d \u2022 \u201c instability may undermine the conditions for expanded output and sustained flows of such resources.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c separatist movements ... revolutionary actions and counter-revolutionary coupe .\nSuch conditions also detract form [ sic ] the environment needed to attract the foreign capital.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expropriation of foreign interests , such action , from an economic viewpoint , is not in the best interests of\u2026 the investing country\u2026 \u201d \u2022 \u201c Considerable reduction in infant and child mortality is possible through improvement in nutrition , inoculations against diseases , and other public health measures if means can be devised for extending such services to neglected LDC populations on a low-cost basis .\nIt often makes sense to combine such activities with family planning services in integrated delivery systems in order to maximize the use of scarce LDC financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .\nIn addition , providing selected health care for both mothers and their children can enhance the acceptability of family planning by showing concern for the whole condition of the mother and her children and not just for the single factor of fertility.\n\u201d \u2022 \u201c \u2026development of drugs which might have other beneficial uses .\nAn example is methotrexate\u2026 first used as an abortifacient\u2026 \u201d If the stealth sterilization scandal proves true\u2014 and at this point it seems to\u2014 Bill Gates and other emissaries of corporate progress are following a well-laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , been called a tax evasion shell by accounting expert Sheldon Drobny\u2014 the vaccine crusade may have panoptic value to patch up the foundations \u2019 image whenever profiteering or oppressive springs poke out of the organization \u2019 s stuffing as much as it \u2019 s a way to use one branch of investments to benefit others .\nGates clearly hopes this effect will work for his legacy , which might explain his Kurtz-like meltdowns when those offerings are rejected or exposed as profiteering or even genocidal power schemes .\nIn what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical jab at Gates \u2019 public health mission , the paperexposed Gates \u2019 African oil holdings for causing the same diseases his foundation vaccinated against in 2007 in a report titled Dark Cloud Over Good Works of Gates Foundation .\nLead author Charles Piller , who was nominated for a Pulitzer for the article , lasted less than a year at the LA Times after continuing his critical series on Gates .\nWhatever reasons drove Piller to leave the Times , it certainly wasn \u2019 t a waning interest in criticizing the Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nation titled How the Gates Foundation \u2019 s Investments Are Undermining Its Own Good Works , Piller reported on Gates \u2019 continued investments in unethical oil , gas and mining operations .\nAs argued in Part 5 , Gates is merely akin to an hydraulic valve , who , when plugged into existing power and profit schemes , amplifies historical interpretations of the current militarized drive for globalization , but otherwise has never done anything original in his life .\nVarious frightening ties of the Gates Foundation are well documented , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the organization been willing to go to advance Gates \u2019 self-professed vision of a more perfect world while making more perfect profits in the process .\nNevertheless , Gates isn \u2019 t the point of this series or even the main focus .\nGates would have merely drawn from an existing agenda .\nBut Gates is handy as an illustration of a particular ideology which combines literal and figurative panoticism , down to the utopian \u201c new man \u201d concepts of teleological evolution , the pseudoscientific and racialized view of \u201c objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the status of viruses , and the viral theory of politics underlying totalitarianism .\nIn the end , these controversies are all about race and nothing about race to the extent that \u201c race \u201d is a floating concept as argued in Part 3 .\nPseudoscientific racial theories can be applied to political views .\nEven the Kenyan government \u2019 s alleged participation and cover-up of mass sterilization doubly illustrates the point by showing that caste systems can exist among populations that are ethnically more or less homogenous , and that this existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darkness-style , to engage a population in its own destruction for the purposes of foreign hegemony .\nIn a report for the Centre for Minority Rights Development titled Caste in Kenya , Kenyan program officer Adam Hussein Adam argues that the Kenyan government has facilitated caste divisions between tribal clans and discrimination .\nAuthor Adam happens to be a member of George Soros \u2019 Open Society Institute\u2014something that might further illustrate the Heart of Darkness theme .\nAccording to critics , Soros engages in philanthropy as a \u201c privileged strategy for generating new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are convergent with the organization \u2019 s interests , and that \u201c far from seeking to curb the excesses of economic globalization , such efforts are actually institutionalizing it by laying the foundations of its own regulatory order.\n\u201d In other words , Soros , like Gates , engages in philanthropy to gather intel on target nations as a Trojan horse for financial and power strategies .\nSoros , whose wide media holdings like AlterNet regularly support compulsory vaccination and attack consumer safety advocates , is a member of Gates \u2019 \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropic campaigns , including population control programs .\nWhether Soros simply supports distribution of information and resources for birth control or backs darker , unethical , arguably racist measures is unknown .\nThe fact that the whistleblower disclosures of senior CDC scientist William Thompson emerged right in the middle of Ferguson , Missouri protests against racist policies highlights a series of convergent themes that might not have been missed by Soros , who poured millions into expanding support for demonstrations nationwide .\nSoros may genuinely support equality and civil justice .\nBut standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Soros-controlled media has done everything in its power to squelch the racial implications of the CDC whistleblower 's revelations .\nBecause of this , the funding could be viewed a form of entryism\u2014 wielding financial influence in an attempt to guard against the movement taking on platforms threatening to Soros ' investments .\nThompson 's disclosures certainly represent a threat in that sense .\nHis reports of research fraud within the Center for Disease Control and the massive dossier of evidence he provided to congress reportedly document that senior CDC researchers buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mumps and rubella vaccine that would have shown a 340 % increase in autism among black male infants who received the MMR before 36 months of age .\nThompson made further claims\u2014that senior CDC scientists , including Dr. Robert Chen\u2014aggressively forced Thompson and others to alter study data showing links between thimerosal , the mercury preservative in vaccines , and symptoms of autism , specifically tic disorders .\nAs if this wasn \u2019 t explosive enough , not only do the original data sets support the controversial autism-vaccine connection according to Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the optics on race brought to light by the scandal are terrible .\nIf Thompson \u2019 s claims prove true , the implications regarding race and the timing of disclosure clearly add another official disincentive to allowing the truth to emerge .\nAfter all , the CDC and American health institutions have a vast history of racist research , programs and policies , including the relatively recent Federal Violence Initiatives which , in the 1990 \u2019 s proposed that African Americans and other minorities carry a \u201c crime gene \u201d requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of \u201c vaccination \u201d against urban violence\u2014an unsettling example of potentially widening interpretation of inoculation that should obviously be watchdogged in the case vaccines are made compulsory in the US .\nThe ultimate expansion of the concept of inoculation was demonstrated by mass sterilization campaigns in Africa , the Philippines and Nicaragua\u2014vaccinating the world against the spread of populations that threaten to , as Kissinger put it , foment \u201c counter-revolutionary coups , \u201d \u201c detract from the environment needed to attract the foreign capital \u201d and \u201c interrupt supply.\n\u201d Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial implications in view of the Carolyn Gallagher and Melody Goodman study , Hepatitis B triple series vaccine and developmental disability in US children aged 1\u20139 years , describing a three-fold rate of autism among male children -- particularly non-white boys\u2014 exposed to the full-mercury Hepatitis B vaccine series starting at birth compared to those who did not .\nThe combined research argues that the highest risk is carried by non-white children\u2014males especially\u2014 though the implied risk is to all children .\nIt \u2019 s as if the risks of a particular technology\u2014vaccination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of the risks of corporatism itself : a threat to everyone with a special emphasis on race .\nEven the most radical political factions hatching within the Ferguson protest movement\u2014 \u201c radical \u201d to the extent that they \u2019 ve reportedly refused to be coopted by various agendas and extraneous influences\u2014recognize that race may simply be the place where the machinery of corporate abuse gains the easiest foothold , though ultimately the threat is to everyone and democracy itself .\nRika Tyler of Hands Up United , in an interview for Truthdig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for-profit system of tickets , fines and imprisonment that buries communities .\nMary Holland \u2019 s recent presentation before the California Senate Judiciary Committee in opposition to that state \u2019 s mandatory vaccination bill , SB277 , could not provide a better illustration of that convergence .\nHolland was aggressively shut down by the committee \u2019 s chairwoman as she asked whether California was prepared to start taking children into state custody to forcibly vaccinate them This entire series dresses up a very simple premise : that chickens ultimately come home to roost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system has long fed and strengthened itself .\nOnly as it adds other societal strata to the menu are more becoming aware of the system , though many remain dangerously divided in their understanding that it \u2019 s all of a piece , all the same machinery .\nThe viral theory of politics and the panoptic , totalitarian view of the \u201c scientifically objective \u201d enemy as a \u201c carrier \u201d of ideological disease probably has no greater expression than direct racism , though that \u2019 s only the start .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it presumes some kind of inherent/genetic psychopathology or criminality of targets .\nBut it \u2019 s obviously easier to apply the conception to those who are palpably different than the accusers in some way\u2014particularly when they \u2019 re sitting on coveted resources .\nPart 7 of

prime illustration of the reasoning behind Kissinger \u2019 s preoccupation with \u201c viral \u201d political uprising and interrupted flow of coopted resources due to the country \u2019 s hidden , violent history of exploitation by\u2014 and empire-killing rebellion against\u2014 foreign occupiers .\nKenya was the site of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usama Bin Laden and al Qaeda to the attention of US intelligence and led immediately to Bill Clinton \u2019 s bombing of a Sudan \u2019 s Al-Shifa pharmacutical manufacturing facility in retaliation , leading to an estimated civilian death toll that

father\u2014 and leading to Odinga , the loser of the election , being appointed Prime Minister as a concession to stop the violence .\nThe charges against Kenyatta were likely politicized to some

That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political , economic , and social stability of the supplying countries .\nWherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can

this history .\nAfrica is still referred to as the \u201c dark continent \u201d because we get so little humanizing information on the hopes , struggles and self-forged successes of the people living in the 54-going-on-55 countries and island nations that make up the continent that isn \u2019 t filtered through the lens of certain exploitative philanthropic organizations which depict only the

the rampant use of African populations as guinea pigs for unethical pharmaceutical trials .\nThough it can \u2019 t be discounted that certain positive aid ventures reach their intended recipients , the various disasters that result from the many seeming attempts to compensate for history through philanthropic measures are partly from Western cultural ignorance , partly due to deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That \u2019 s the major source of darkness .\nAnd oil is dark too .\nA list of the world \u2019 s coveted strategic resources\u2014the flow of which was so concerning to Kissinger\u2014 inculdes gold , diamonds , uranium , cobalt , iron , copper , manganese , bauxite , silver , agricultural products and timber , etc.\n, though the battle for resource control always rages hardest over oil and

it \u2019 s producing nuclear weapons .\nThe country recently asked , perhaps tongue in cheek , for the countries collectively maintaining over 16,000 warheads\u2014the United States , Russia , United Kingdom , France , China , India , Pakistan , Israel and North Korea\u2014to think about gradual disarmament .\nGas and pipelines largely explain the US proxy war in the Ukraine against Russia , why it \u2019 s almost never described by the media as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives within a year in that conflict seems to matter less than celebrity news .\nOil is obviously one of the main stakes of the Iraq war .\nAnother was the privatization of war itself , though biofuel fueled it all .\nThe militarized Halliburton program in the Middle East is just a sample among many in the \u201c struggle for dependence \u201d on the world \u2019 s dwindling biofuel stores .\nAs David Vine , anthropology professor and author ofIsland of Shame : The Secret History of the U.S. Military Base on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The sad irony is that any legitimate desire to maintain the free flow of regional oil to the global economy could be sustained through other far less expensive and deadly means .\nMaintaining scores of bases costing billions of dollars a year is unnecessary to protect oil supplies and ensure regional peace -- especially in an era in which the United States gets only around 10 % of its net oil and natural gas from the region .\nIn addition to the direct damage our military spending has caused , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of alternative energy sources that could free the United States and the world from a dependence on Middle Eastern oil -- and from the cycle of war that our military bases have fed .\nVine focuses on the growing number of US military bases in oil rich countries which often provide support for despotic regimes : \u201c \u2026since 1980 , the U.S. military has gradually garrisoned the Greater Middle East in a fashion only rivaled by the Cold War garrisoning of Western Europe.\n\u201d And again , biofuel may explain why Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity .\nHomeland Security advisor Lisa Monaco \u2019 s divulgence last year that vaccine philanthropy has been repeatedly used as cover for military operations raises the question of whether the fact that Africa has also been a hotbed of vaccine and other forms of foreign medical aid may have been a conscious lead-in for occupation .\nThere have been warnings for several years that a full-scale invasion of Africa was imminent and it \u2019 s clear that the incentives for occupation exist in terms of Africa \u2019 s frackable shale deposits and stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 article titled , The Real Invasion of Africa is Not News and a Licence to Lie is Hollywood 's Gift , The Guardian \u2019 s John Pilger wrote , A

rivalry with China .\nUnlike China , the US and its allies are prepared to use a degree of violence demonstrated in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Yemen and Palestine .\nAs in the cold war , a division of labour requires that western journalism and popular culture provide the cover of a holy war against a `` menacing arc '' of Islamic extremism , no different from the bogus `` red menace '' of a worldwide communist conspiracy .\nReminiscent of the Scramble for Africa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Command ( Africom ) has built a network of supplicants among collaborative African regimes eager for American bribes and armaments .\nLast year , Africom staged Operation African Endeavor , with the armed forces of 34 African nations taking part , commanded by the US military .\nAfricom 's `` soldier to soldier '' doctrine embeds US officers at every level of command from general to warrant officer .\nOnly pith helmets are missing .\nAs Nick Turse reports for The Nation in 2015 , this

the documents .\nAll told , the 2nd Brigade Combat Team , 1st Infantry Division carried out 128 separate \u201c activities \u201d in 28 African countries during all of 2013 .\nThen last year \u2019 s African Ebola outbreak which killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Liberia\u2014an event quickly followed by pronouncements of a human vaccine trials for the disease\u2014 exposed a blatant panopticism that has been the traditional entering wedge for occupation on that continent all along .\nAt issue is nothing less than horrifying death as a rationale to curtail freedom and impose elements of martial law .\nCountries were closing borders and criminalizing failure to report , as would be expected for an actually deadly epidemic .\nBut martial law within affected countries wasn \u2019 t the most blatant expression of panopticism .\nFollowing news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public surprise that 3,000 American troops were sent to Africa to \u201c fight Ebola.\n\u201d It \u2019 s a pattern that few question these days since Americans have long been trained to view African populations as backwards , hysterical , anti-progress and clearly in need of containment and management like the many diseases\u2014AIDS , malaria , cholera , etc.\u2014 that plague African nations .\nFrom Murdoch-held Vox : In an address from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta , Obama said that the US is willing to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus .\nEbola `` is a global threat , and it demands a truly global response , '' Obama said .\n`` This is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security .\nIt 's a potential threat to global security , if these countries break down , if their economies break down , if people panic , '' he said .\n`` That has profound effects on all of us , even if we are not directly contracting the disease . ''\nThis outbreak is already `` spiraling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as torture produced no valuable intel yet was successful in justifying an invasion of Iraq , and just as the vaccination drive used as cover for Neptune Spear was worthless in terms of protecting against hepatitis B , sending US troops to manage Ebola has been a travesty as well , though this begs the question of whether it \u2019 s been successful in another sense .\nIn an article titled Empty Ebola Clinics in Liberia are Seen as Misstep in U.S .\nRelief Effort , the New York Times reports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of dollars and deploying nearly 3,000 troops to build Ebola treatment centers , the United States ended up creating facilities that have largely sat empty : Only 28 Ebola patients have been treated at the 11

justifying a similar expansion of militarization at home .\nBut after attempts to sensationalize the few cases that spread from returning aid workers and vaccine industry avatar Nancy Synderman \u2019

a militarized pharmaceutical scheme .\nThe updated anthrax claims , made by imprisoned Anonymous hacktivist , Matt DeHart , a former Air National Guard intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was behind the anthrax attacks in 2001\u2014 already a popular theory in the fringe media .\nOn the one hand , it doesn \u2019 t seem that far fetched that an industry which conducts unethical drug trials on the poor and indigent worldwide and kills more than 200 thousand Americans a year with prescription drugs could in some way be responsible for a lethal contagion .\nAnd it \u2019 s feasible that a public health administration and regulators incompetent and crooked enough to lose track of vials of active small pox , avian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt enough to cover up Vioxx risks , etc.\n, could fail to report that an outbreak of a deadly disease occurring due to human error in the course of vaccine or containment research .\nOr worse .\nBut , in the case of Ebola , it would be extremely difficult to prove and is in many ways beside the point .\nWhether certain events were outside Western control or not , the most accessible proof of malfeasance is often how these events are used to wag the dog and advance agendas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until any evidence surfaces , the pursuit of unprovable theories of how something happens could seem almost like deliberate avoidance of indisputable and politically rife effects that demonstrate a more likely route to hold public figures accountable for criminal acts\u2014if that is really the point .\nThe 9/11 attacks were used to launch a profitable

to kill Bin Laden were reported around the world .\nBut almost no Western media picked up Pakistan media reports of a warlord \u2019 s explanations for vaccine resistance .\nOne explanation was the use of vaccine drives as cover for drone strokes and another was that the area had gone without electricity for thirty years and children were dying as a direct result\u2014 the implication being that if drives were really from a sincere attempt to help , other deadly infrasctructure problems would have been addressed .\nIt was mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to an Express Tribune report , a senior Taliban Commander in the North Waziristan Agency , Hafiz Gul Bahadur , explained that \u201c Polio infects one child in a million , but hundreds of Waziri women , children and elders have been killed in these strikes.\n\u201d The pamphlet went on to explain that constant surveillance in the region was causing mental breakdowns among residents : \u201c Each day the list of psychological patients increases in Waziristan , which is worse than Polio.\n\u201d \u201c We are without electricity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redressing the problem .\nThe government is least bothered to look into

, it might be poetic justice that the Ebola outbreak temporarily suspended Exxon \u2019 s plans for offshore drilling in Liberia last year .\nDrilling plans for offshore Liberia have been delayed due

offshore Liberia .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ or engineered , motives to use the events opportunistically are obvious .\nAll three countries\u2014Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia\u2014 have been identified as rich in gas and oil and it \u2019 s undeniable is that poverty and the ravages of wars for dwindling resources , exploitation and resulting instability have contributed to the spread of disease .\nEven prior to the natural gas frenzy , deforestation , corruption and pollution in Sierra Leone from gold and diamond mining have triggered longstanding degradation of human health and the environment and the destabilization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [ Guinea , Sierra Leone and Liberia ] have poor health infrastructure , due in part to years of civil war in Liberia and Sierra Leone .\nLiberia

nations of Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone have a shared , brutal history of civil wars that since 1989 have left more than 400,000 people dead , displaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , seen rape used as a weapon against tens of thousands of girls and women , and put Liberia 's former President behind bars as a war criminal .\n\u2026 In these three nations , few families have not experienced murders , rapes , torture , maiming , loss of homes and death .\nThough the recent story of a vaccination campaign disaster in Syria which caused the deaths of up to fifty children wasn \u2019 t conclusive about what might have caused the injuries , the philanthropic campaign does seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The UN has halted a measles vaccination campaign in northern Syria after at least 15 children died after receiving shots , the UN Children \u2019 s Fund ( UNICEF ) and World Health Organization ( WHO ) confirmed in a joint statement .\n\u201c UNICEF and WHO have been shocked and saddened to learn of the deaths of at least 15 young children in Idlib , Syria , \u201d the statement said .\n\u201c The deaths of the children occurred in areas where a measles immunization campaign had been under way.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two , Reuters reported , citing aid workers .\nAround one hour after being given a second round of the measles vaccine in Idlib on Tuesday , the children demonstrated signs of \u201c severe allergic shock , \u201d said Abdullah Ajaj , a physician administering the vaccinations at a medical center in Jarjanaz , according to AP .\nThe second round of vaccinations began in Idlib and Deir Ezzour on Monday .\nFollowing the vaccine , some of the children \u2019 s bodies swelled and they suffocated to death .\n\u201c There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for the parents .\nYou get your child vaccinated and then you find your child dying , it \u2019 s very hard , \u201d Ajaj said .\nConflicting statements from the Syrian opposition and reports from rights groups have put the number of vaccine-related deaths between 34 and 50 .\nBeyond the scramble for oil and gas , GM tech also provides a parallel give-and-grab illustration involving some familiar players : This week the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID hosted a meeting in London with big agribusinesses to discuss strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa .\nThe location of the meeting was secret .\nSo was the agenda .\nAttendance was strictly invite-only and nobody who even came close to representing African small farmers was invited .\nMeanwhile farmers and food sovereignty activists met at the World Social Forum in Tunis , Tunisia to discuss their solutions to the problems of our food system .\nThese two meetings represent not just two different types of meeting \u2013 a closed , secretive meeting of the powerful versus an open , democratic meeting of grassroots activists \u2013 but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our food .\nOne is based on corporate control and would generate vast profits for a small elite ; the second is centred on sustainable , democratic , local food production .\n`` There is powerful evidence that organic farming practices and local seeds used by small-holder farmers are able to produce more food on less land and with less water than industrial agriculture . ''\nAs often was the case in colonial times the corporate agenda in Africa is today often disguised as paternalistic benevolence .\nFriendly-sounding projects such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , and the DfID-supported New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition promise to eliminate hunger by creating the conditions that will bring new corporate technologies and more big business investment to African agriculture .\nOn the face of it that all sounds very good .\nSo why this level of secrecy for the meetings about the projects ?\nSamwel Messiak , a Tanzanian food campaigner I met in Tunis tells a very different story of the corporate agenda for Africa \u2019 s food .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Alliance has helped corporations \u201c buy \u201d land off local communities without their consent and without paying them compensation for their lost land .\nThis is because the corporate agenda of AGRA and the New Alliance threaten to move control of land and seeds into corporate hands .\nThe push for corporate engagement in Africa \u2019 s agriculture also has a strong focus on producing cash crops for consumption in richer parts of the world ( a practice started in colonial times ) which if anything provides less food for people living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific cases of panoptic coups and color revolutions .\nAdriana Gamondes is a Contributing Editor to Age of Autism and one of the blog \u2019 s Facebook administrators .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/705004780/0/ageofautism.html", "published": "2022-08-03T06:00:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1659520800, "collection_utc": 1659564097}, {"id": "ageofautism--2022-08-04--Travel Mask Mandate In Our Future?", "date": "2022-08-04", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Travel Mask Mandate In Our Future?", "content": "Note : Mask mandates can be highly discriminatory to children and adults with autism .\nThe lock down never really ended once mask mandates were in place .\nEven just walking through a store became impossible for some .\nAnd the mandates opened those unable to wear a mask to ridicule , scorn and violence .\nMost of us are caring enough to stay HOME if we are so sick that we need to wear a mask .\nWithout a mandate .\nSome of us attempted to help our loved ones with autism to tolerate a mask .\nI did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to be 'compliant .

were often imprisoned in chaotic circumstances .\nCh\u00e1vez ( and Nicol\u00e1sMaduro after him ) had been accused of pocketing vast sums from public coffers and making disastrous populist decisions , such as showing leniency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over districts throughout the country .\nBut Ch\u00e1vez was nevertheless democratically elected and the country \u2019 s media is still largely owned by members of the former oligarchy .\nThe issue of crushing poverty under the oligarchy has reportedly improved by 80 % .\nSeveral criminal gangs were recently disbanded for facilitating the opposition \u2019 s scheme to destabilize currency in the wake of the failed , allegedly US-backed attempted coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat against Ch\u00e1vez in 2002 .\nIt \u2019 s also interesting that following a rash of vaccine and public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venezuela \u2019 s current President Maduro accused right-wing opponents of fomenting another coup with US support in the oil-rich country following President Obama \u2019 s executive order declaring Venezuela a threat to national security , a charge repudiated by the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States ( CELAC ) in what it called an \u201c application of unilateral coercive measures that are contrary to international law.\n\u201d Aside from denouncing vaccine safety critics as \u201c child killers \u201d and investing in a fracking corporation , in 2011 , Bill Gates celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conjunction with GlaxoSmithKline .\nIn 2010 , the US and Venezuela both refused to exchange ambassadors following accusations that the 2002 coup against Ch\u00e1vez had been supported by the US .\nThe year before , launched the Amazon Malaria Initiative was launched by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , an agency cited as a major implementer of neoliberal privatization schemes around the world and , again , a front for the CIA .\nRelations with Venezuela have been strained since , but by 2012 , the experimental malaria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , presumably to address a deadly epidemic of malaria .\nIn 2010 , it was widely reported that malaria had wiped out three Yanomami villages in the Amazonian rain forest .\nIt was claimed malaria was brought in by illegal gold miners .\nThe problem with the story is that malaria is endemic to the Amazon , not communicable between humans and indigenous people may be the least susceptible due to generational exposure .\nThough survivors were said to be infected with malaria , the report was unclear whether these survivors were effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease in fact caused the majority of deaths .\nThe counter argument has been that the miners brought in a new strain , were bitten by mosquitoes which then spread the disease to members of the tribe .\nA regional health official , Dr. Carlos Botto , said the initial accounts and tests have shown there was some type of epidemic and evidence of malaria .\nBut he said the number of deaths remained unclear and further tests were needed to determine if other diseases could be involved .\nHe said other officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission .\n\u201c What \u2019 s certain is that there was an epidemic with deaths , \u201d Botto said in a telephone interview .\nHe said the number of deaths reported by those in the communities was just an estimate\u2026 \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen it like this , \u201d said Shatiwe Luis Ahiwei , another Yanomami health worker who assisted in the medical mission and said about 100 more malaria cases had been identified in the area , more than half of them the deadly falciparum strain .\nThe sick have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vomiting and bloody diarrhea\u2026 Isolation has left the Yanomami vulnerable to many illnesses such as measles , yellow fever and hepatitis that have been spread by outsiders .\nIndigenous rights activist Christina Haverkamp said that the government response has been slow and inadequate , and that doctors need access to helicopters to reach people in other areas where similar situations have been reported .\n\u201c Many Yanomami are dying and need help , \u201d said Haverkamp , a German who runs the organization Yanomami-Hilfe and has worked among the Yanomami for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is common in the Yanomami region , and Haverkamp said she has caught it four times over the years .\nBut she said she has never seen such a serious outbreak .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a catastrophe and also a scandal that they still don \u2019 t \u2026 have it under control , \u201d she said .\nOfficials in President Hugo Chavez \u2019 s government insist they have improved and expanded medical care through a program called the Yanomami Health Plan , investing in clinics and also training some of the Yanomami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages .\nAmerican missionaries belonging to the group New Tribes Mission used to aid sick villagers , but in 2005 Chavez expelled them , accusing them of conducting espionage .\n\u201c With the missionaries , health care was better under control , \u201d at least in areas where they worked , Haverkamp said .\nNationwide , the Health Ministry says 39,658 malaria cases have been reported so far in 2010 , an increase of about 42 percent compared to the same period last year .\nThe report does not list fatalities .\nHaverkamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Yanomami may be due to an influx of malaria-infected Brazilian gold miners working in illegal camps near indigenous settlements , and she said the military should evict the miners .\nThe missionaries that Ch\u00e1vez expelled in 2005 , the New Tribes Mission , were profiled a book by Norman Lewis , The Missionaries : God Against the Indians , that described the brutal tactics of certain global missionary groups as well as the casual understanding in Latin America that several fronted for military and industrial interests .\nNew Tribes , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 , has been cited for violent conversion tactics in many countries or plying trust from indigenous leaders while scoping natural resources for various industries and maintaining ties to the CIA .\nFrom Fox News : Anthropologists , military officials and others have accused the group of watching indigenous people die of malnutrition while living in luxurious camps , forcing communities to give up ancestral traditions and creating a sophisticated enclave of airstrips and settlements to exploit gold , quartz and even uranium deposits .\n`` This is not a problem that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Alberto Muller , a retired general and ex-governor of the region who left office in 1985 .\n`` Since my time as governor , ( the missionaries ) have really alarmed me . ''\nSince first establishing a presence in Venezuela in 1946 , the group has repeatedly been investigated , though each time the controversy fizzled out .\nVice President Jose Vicente Rangel started calling New Tribes a security threat as early as 1981 .\nTomas Antonio Marino Blanco , a navy captain , recently revived claims first made in 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense contractors from Westinghouse conduct mineral prospecting .\nThe group denies the accusations and is seeking to meet directly with Chavez to discuss the issue .\nIt also says it is willing to open its camps to government observers to quell suspicions .\nAs with Ebola speculations , how an outbreak occurred can distract from the effects of the remedy .\nAs with the vaccine drive used in the Neptune Spear operation to kill Bin Laden , the Amazonian malaria vaccine drive brought up questions of agendas as well as safety .\nIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malaria vaccine \u2019 s success , the vaccine was 34.8 % effective in reducing severe malaria for the combined age-group category and carried heavy risks .\nIn a maneuver commonly used by the pharmaceutical companies to undercut perceived risks , the \u201c placebo '' used to compare the malaria vaccine was a rabies vaccine known to cause neuroparalytic accidents .\nNormally , placebos used in double blind trials are supposed to be benign\u2014 a saline shot or a sugar pill\u2014though vaccine trials generally use non-inert , toxic placebos like aluminum that would produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , even when compared to a vaccine with particularly high risks for neurological adverse events , the malaria vaccine still proved more dangerous .\nWhether the vaccine had been safe , effective and warranted or not , and regardless of the sincerity of various health workers who implement health programs in the Amazon , it \u2019 s unfortunately necessary to ask whether certain health campaigns in resource-rich regions which happen to be the targets of corporate hegemony might be cover for something else .\nAs it happens , Yanomami-Hilfe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsored by the transnational Bayer AG and its tropical disease project , Innovative Vector Control Consortium , which is in turn co-sponsored by the Gates Foundation .\nBayer\u2014 the original manufacturer of Ceresan , from which the mercury preservative in vaccines is derived\u2014has a long history of involvement with political conflict and human rights abuses going back to its activities under the Third Reich and , more recently , its investment in \u201c conflict minerals \u201d \u2014namely coltan from the Congo .\nThe documentary Blood Coltan illustrates the trail of death and war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral since the US-backed assassination of Congo \u2019 s first Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba .\nColtan , also known as tantalum , is used to produce cell phones , computer chips , weaponry and aircraft components .\nA 2003 UN report exposed corporations\u2014including Bayer\u2014that invest in Congolese coltan .\nThough Bayer sold its coltan-processing subsidiary H.C. Starck to the Carlyle Group in 2007 , coltan may still be relevant to the issue at hand since Venezuela \u2019 s announcement in 2012 that significant deposits of coltan have been discovered , making Venezuela one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reserves of \u201c blue gold.\n\u201d The Carlyle Group owns and invests in private security and surveillance companies ( United Defense , Booz Allen Hamilton ) , electronics and aircraft , all of which depend on technology requiring coltan and , since the UN report naming companies that invest in coltan , the pressure has been on to find supposedly conflict-free sources .\nUnder Carlyle \u2019 s ownership , H.C. Starck voluntarily agreed to do just that .\nThe argument that questioning the sincerity of global medical philanthropy could cost lives ignores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue gold , black gold , etc . )\nleaves trails of death as well .\nThe same pattern of medical philanthropy preceding military machination had been seen in the Ukraine prior to US and EU installation of a regime with widely reputed neo-Nazi ties as Michael Hughes reports in Huffington Post , The Obama administration has vehemently denied charges that Ukraine 's nascent regime is stock full of neo-fascists despite clear evidence suggesting otherwise .\nSuch categorical repudiations lend credence to the notion the U.S. facilitated the anti-Russian cabal 's rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw Ukraine into the West 's sphere of influence .\nEven more disturbing are apologists , from the American left and right , who seem willing accomplices in this obfuscation of reality , when just a cursory glance at the profiles of Ukraine 's new leaders should give pause to the most zealous of Russophobes .\nUNICEF \u2019 s surveillance of \u201c anti-vaccine \u201d attitudes in Eastern Europe , including the Ukraine , might mesh neatly with panoptic intelligence operations .\nThe lengthy report , which cites Seth Mnookin as a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panic Virus \u201d ) approach , involved data collected and synthesized from social media in four languages by Attention USA , a PR and \u201c competitive intelligence \u201d agency that uses NSA-style corporate surveillance technology such as Radian6 and Sysomos and has clients like Microsoft and the Washington Post-owned , for-profit higher education corporation Kaplan University and several pharmaceutical companies .\nThe document also names American vaccine safety advocacy blogs and publications such as Dr. Tenpenny , Mothering Magazineand The Refusers as primary negative \u201c influencers \u201d in Eastern Europe .\nThe UNICEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question raised in Part 2 of this series over whether attitudes towards vaccination in the US and American publications and advocacy groups that question safety might be viewed as \u201c contagious \u201d abroad and thus threatening to military operations that were dependant on foreign trust of vaccine philanthropy\u2014threatening enough on their own to conceivably launch a mass media campaign to inoculate against them .\nAfter Homeland Security \u2019 s Lisa Monaco received the bracing letter from public health school deans , it \u2019 s possible that the nature of \u201c rescue \u201d campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift to other tactics .\nYet war always leaves a trail of disease and decimation of health infrastructure in its wake\u2014itself a gift that keeps giving in generating an opening wedge for panoptic operations .\nEndless war , mass surveillance and globalization may partly rest on a bed of permanent contagion .\nAgain , because of the nature of covert operations , it \u2019 s difficult to gauge to what extent vaccine philanthropy has been used as a Trojan horse for wars motivated by control of resources .\nBut the often damaging effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes harder to justify staying silent about the dual use of philanthropy in the hopes that the more driving intention of the two-sided agenda is to save children around the globe from disease .\nIt does at times .\nBut it too often does double the damage as the Hippocratic principle `` first do no harm '' is corroded by the rules of war in the merger of irreconcilable aims .\nIf the central point has not always been health and human welfare to begin with , we can \u2019 t legitimately expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we accept that global medical philanthropy often has a weaponized agenda , then we tacitly accept that public health may move towards war-level collateral and that the system cutting its teeth on secrecy and a military partnership in our name will come home , becoming an entry point for domestic repression and the same colonial divide and conquer strategies waged against other populations .\nThe next segments of the series looks into the astroturf groups who \u201c come down from the hill after the battle to shoot the wounded , \u201d sow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ideological , social and actual wars .\nAdriana Gamondes is a Contributing Editor to Age of Autism and one of the blog \u2019 s

despite sometimes outrageous conduct and statements , the group seems to have plenty of institutional support .\nIn a corporocratic world , institutional support and a teflon veneer frequently imply

, our drone strikes in Pakistan kill innocent people\u2014and this undoubtedly creates new enemies for the West .\nBut we wouldn \u2019 t need to drop a single bomb on Pakistan , or anywhere else , if a death cult of devout Muslims weren \u2019 t making life miserable for millions of innocent people and posing an unacceptable threat of violence to open societies .\nHarris has been even less euphemistic in other writings : \u201c Some beliefs are so dangerous that it may be ethical to kill people for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith ) '' \u2026the people who speak most sensibly about the threat that Islam poses to Europe are actually fascists . ''\n( The End of Liberalism ) '' there are tens of millions of people in the Muslim world who are far scarier than Dick Cheney . ''\n( The End of Liberalism ) '' We should profile Muslims , or anyone who looks like he or she could conceivably be Muslim . ''\n( In Defense of Profiling ) '' I am one of the few ... who has argued ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our war on terror . ''\n( In Defense of Torture ) And just to clarify what Harris means by ethically necessary torture : Thumbscrews may be applied , or toe screws , or a pear-shaped device may be inserted into your mouth , vagina or anus until your misery admits of no possible increase .\nYou may be hoisted to the ceiling on a strappado ( with your arms bound behind your back and attached to a pulley , and weights tied to your feet ) , dislocating your shoulders .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the strappado and exposing this unpleasant fellow to the suasions of bygone times .\n( The End of Faith ) The Skeptic front tends to combine campaigns through use of the same language to defend both commercial products ( GMOs , vaccines , psychiatric drugs , food additives , etc . )\nand the military aggression of the US and its allies and the same language to dismiss the humanity of the victims of any of it .\nThe group also uses the same language to define , condemn and equate both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d .\nBut these attitudes , expressions , condemnations , false equivocations and rationalizations are what define the group themselves .\nThese are the \u201c gestics \u201d of the Skeptics : the surgical removal of all consequences of abuse of industrial power , though to qualify as a \u201c social gest , \u201d it \u2019 s the body count that defines .\nIn a series of essays published as Brecht on Theatre , German poet and playwright Berthold Brecht describes a special approach to performance in which expression and language are grounded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social gestics \u201d \u2014social as in political and politicized by being infused with and exposing the consequences of corruption .\nAt some point in virtually all of Brecht \u2019 s work , the seductive or comical zeitgeist the audience may have been enjoying flips sickeningly into a ditch and the entertaining , moody essence turns fluorescent , revealing gruesome violence and raw suffering .\nJust to flog the German theme again , the approach was intended to trigger bildung\u2014a moment of political awakening in the audience that enables , as James Baldwin wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in themselves \u201d and \u201c themselves in history.\n\u201d Brecht 's goal was to \u201c get the enemy [ audience ] at close range and induce in them a seismic response , \u201d just as , in the early 1930 \u2019 s , Brecht envisioned the evolution of radio into something interactive and akin to the internet .\nBrecht showed little interest in the technical aspects of communication devices , focusing instead on the revolutionary political potential of technology to hold public institutions accountable : [ Q ] uite apart from the dubiousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it should be two- .\nIt is purely an apparatus for distribution , for mere sharing out .\nSo here is a positive suggestion : change this apparatus over from distribution to communication .\nThe radio would be the finest possible communication apparatus in public life , a vast network of pipes .\nThat is to say , it would be if it knew how to receive as well as to transmit , how to let the listener speak as well as hear , how to bring him into a relationship instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to do it must strive to combat that lack of consequences which makes such asses of almost all our public institutions .\nWe have a literature without consequences , which not only itself sets out to lead nowhere , but does all it can to neutralize its readers by depicting each object and situation stripped of the consequences to which they lead .\nWe have educational establishments without consequences , working frantically to hand on an education that leads nowhere and has come from nothing\u2026 It should be clear from reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , just as many forms of communication technology go two ways today , so does the spectator component .\nIn the modern explosion of online human rights and environmental activism\u2014anti-fracking , Keystone and Ferguson protests , March Against Monsanto , Occupy and Arab Spring , etc.\u2014 the web , Twitter and other communication tech have been used to foment and sustain social resistance .\nThis has triggered a backlash by corporate and institutional power to regain control and , in turn , a counter backlash of hacktvism to spy on the spies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had Brecht further developed his theory of radio , he would likely have foreseen the panoptic boomerang effect of repression and surveillance and might also have perfectly staged a depiction of the front groups and astroturf troll networks assigned with reigning in , diverting , undermining and destroying this growing web-age bildung .\nAnother constant theme of Brecht \u2019 s is a deconstruction of totalitarianism itself , how it comes in by stealth , pretending to be something other than it is in order to destroy first that which could derail the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying the gist or gest before it takes hold and keeping an eye on the corpses lining the parade route .\nBringing up Berthold Brecht is a response to another defining industrial \u201c gestic \u201d \u2014expropriation of culture .\nIn 2007 , National Institute of Mental Health director Thomas Insel , head of the IACC or Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee which has filled the panel in with several Skeptic-affiliated members , gave a speech to the National Autism Association conference in which he made a wordy effort to wet-blanket parental impatience to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's closing remarks , he led off with a power point mildly misquoting the socialist playwright \u2019 s A Life of Galileo , probably belying Insel \u2019 s attempt to simultaneously pander and con conference attendees on the corporate \u201c watermelon \u201d assumptions that all environmental activists are anarchists and socialists ( green on the outside , red on the inside ) , and then went on to warp Brecht \u2019 s overall meaning : '' One of the chief causes of poverty in science is imaginary wealth .\nThe purpose of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infinitude of wisdom but set some limit to the infinitude of error . ''\n( Brecht , Life of Galileo ) Now , I started my remarks by telling you that we know a very small part of what we need to know .\nI would imagine it 's under 10 % .\nMany of you think you know the answers and we want to hear those .\nBut I want you to understand that we set a very , very high bar in science - that most of what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is `` 1 % inspiration and 99 % perspiration . ''\nSo , it takes three months to make a finding and ten years to try to falsify it before you really believe it .\nSome of you do n't have ten years to wait .\nI understand that .\nBut , our goal , here , is to make sure we do set a very high bar and that when we tell you something , it 's something that we know can be replicated not just for your child , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there 's a lot at stake .\nSo , the idea of setting a limit on the infinitude of error is extremely important to us and is a sort of guiding principle to make sure that we are trying to test as many different ideas as possible , but putting a very high bar on what we would accept as a test of any given idea before we feel that it 's proven .\nThe gest of laying a possessive paw on Galileo , Brecht and other dead intelligentsia is as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intellectual territory in the name of the crown .\nThese figures belong to us , their bodies of work argue for us , so you need look no deeper into these sources .\nThere is no wisdom for you to grasp here that will help you resist\u2026 \u201d But as it turns out , there is .\nIn a direct reproach of totalitarian science , what Brecht ( via Galileo ) meant was that science risks becoming a church itself if it presumes too much value to its traditional wisdom ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom when it is not ) and must retest and review every time-honored assumption .\nInsel also makes reference to Karl Popper \u2019 s scientific method\u2014the theory of falsifiability .\nOf course , as we know , regulators at that time were not only not trying to uncover environmental factors in autism but were , as the whistleblower William Thompson disclosed , actively burying them\u2014falsifying data in the sense of scientific fraud , not in the Popperian sense of legitimately trying to disprove a theory .\nAccording to author , Pulitzer winning journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Obama administration for the \u201c indefinite detention \u201d clause in the National Defense Authorization Act , Chris Hedges , after 9/11 , Skeptic icons such as Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris and the late Christopher Hitchens opportunistically geared their brand of pseudo-secular evangelism to public fear of Muslim militancy and government war footing .\nIt was a successful PR maneuver and brought all three added attention in the media , though this was merely the opening pass of a kind of glorious cultural McRevolution to replace culture with the church of corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but does not end there .\nAs Brecht implies , the difference between the church appropriating science or science becoming a church is generally moot : after all , Brecht wrote the play while in exile in Denmark after having escaped the Nazis , the ultimate manifestation of scientism as the church of hegemonic power .\nIn both instances , it \u2019 s the merger between science and religion that defines a cult while each on their own may not .\nIn his critique of Skeptic icons such as Dawkins , Harris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's New Fundamentalists , Hedges writes , All cults foster a class of high priests who speak of human possibility and progress in obscure , specialized jargon .\nThey talk of miracles .\nThey promise a healthy , long and wonderful life , one where human suffering will be vanquished and peace and happiness will prevail .\nJesus makes this possible for fundamentalist Christians ; science makes it possible for the new atheists .\n..\nThese atheists , like religious fundamentalists , seek the imprint of science , reason and scholarship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in society are not religious .\nThey are legal and scientific\u2026The secular fundamentalists , in a gross misuse of Darwin , also distort science to turn biological evolution into a methodology to perfect the human race .\nThe use of pseudoscience is part of the atheist and the Christian fundamentalist movements .\nBoth camps seek to give to their arguments the patina of unassailable truth and scientific legitimacy .\nBut what they sell are myths , new forms of faith and the self-delusion that makes these fantasies possible .\nThe bible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that human nature is fixed and irredeemable .\nIf there \u2019 s any lingering question about why a movement that presents itself as primarily secular is so fixated on vaccination , the obvious answer is religious exemptions .\nThese exemptions are simply an emblem of cultural power to resist corporate dominance .\nOn the viral theory of dissent , any cultural base of resistance is viewed as a disease that can spread and must be inoculated against .\nPhilosophical exemptions would be as well except these are only offered in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main obstacle to both literal and figurative inoculation against both literal and figurative contagion .\nThis May , a federal bill mandating vaccines for all school children was introduced by Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson .\nH.R .\n2232 would do away with all vaccine exemptions other than medical , which , as the bill stipulates , must be issued by a physician and \u201c must conform to accepted standard of medical care.\n\u201d As mentioned in Part 1 , accepted standards for medical exemptions are set by the industry-embedded Advisory Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even a life threatening reaction to one vaccine would equate to exemptions from others and only a temporally limited exemption from the vaccine that caused injury .\nThe above bill was introduced by a Democrat and it \u2019 s clear from media coverage of the measles outbreak that virtually every left-leaning publication is championing forced vaccination ; in fact , the entire agenda has been pushed the most heavily by the mainstream left .\nTime will tell what happens to this bill but another obvious question is how and why did incursions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groovy , political left thing ?\nThe general challenge for Skeptics seems to be selling industrial and state atrocity on a politically progressive platform , the group \u2019 s most defining gest .\nAccording to 20th century philosopher Karl Raimund Popper , this has been a recognized challenge since Plato .\nFrom Popper \u2019 s The Open Society and Its Enemies : The Spell of Plato : Summing up , we can say that Plato \u2019 s theory of justice , as presented in the Republic and later works , is a conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalitarian , individualistic and protectionist tendencies of his time , and to re-establish the claim of tribalism by creating a totalitarian moral theory\u2026 And he successfully enlisted humanitarian sentiments , whose strength he knew so well , in the cause of the totalitarian class rule of a naturally superior master race .\nIn other words , authoritarianism as a rule must somehow enlist or at least bamboozle the political left in order to take hold and this is done through the creation of an encompassing ideology\u2014a moral theory of justice\u2014that the humanitarian element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where science comes in handy .\nHumanitarians , individualists and equalitarians have apparently always ( fucking ) loved science , or at least the patina of it .\nAs Age of Autism editor Dan Olmsted\u2014a self-described progressive himself\u2014 argued five years ago , progressives are also stuck on the concept of \u201c progress \u201d \u2014sometimes blindly and at any cost .\n\u201c Science , \u201d despite it \u2019 s many potentially oppressive applications and the rooting of 20th century totalitarianism in scientific rationales as discussed in Part 3 , is generally perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern age .\nA Pew survey found that more than half of all scientists lean towards what they believe are liberal politics\u2014a higher percentage than the general population .\nThe organized Skeptic collective tends to slap their campaigns with progressive brand logos like gay marriage , equality and climate change , but self-identification as liberal may be more a matter of group branding than support for genuinely liberal policies .\nExpressing concern for the poor and downtrodden , for instance , is not always in keeping with the outcomes of certain policies just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always resulted in better health and the war on terror has not increased public safety .\nThis is all the more true because astroturf groups for commercial science and other industries , particularly the Skeptics , specialize in peddling draconian institutional and anti-environmental industrial policies as somehow groovy and progressive to hoodwink the public in a process referred to as \u201c reverse culture jamming \u201d ( mentioned in an earlier article ) .\nBorrowing a description of it from UC Santa Cruz anthropology professor Susan Harding \u2019 s Get Religion , industry mouthpieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional ideology by \u201c appropriating , poaching , channeling , ventriloquism \u201d and \u201c revoicing \u201d the message into a progressive journalistic \u201c pitch \u201d in order to shepherd an errant faction of mainstream progressives back towards the approved and conditioned thoughts and beliefs from which they \u2019 d wandered .\nThe humanistic and ecological sounding rhetoric means absolutely nothing .\nFor the purposes of the pharmaceutical industry and public health authorities invested in defending the absolute safety and effectiveness of the vaccination program and other commercial science products , these journalistic \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and empty allegories\u2014most of which couldn \u2019 t legally be issued by industry itself\u2014 are uncritically spread through cooperating media to be detonated by policy makers .\nAs I also argued in an earlier post , quite often the purveyors of these policies are steeped in their own rationalizations .\nIn the introduction to Nuclear Rites , Stanford anthropologist Hugh Gusterson explains why he approached a formal study of atomic weapons scientists in the same manner he \u2019 d approach a tribal culture : \u201c one powerful Western institution that is particularly understudied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gusterson , nuclear weapons scientists \u2019 faith in the ultimate morality of their work and that this morality stems from the problems they \u2019 re charged with solving ( namely the belief that winning the arms race would prevent nuclear strikes by less evolved nations ) explains the field \u2019 s euphemization of risks , romanticization of their technology and exaggerated self-assurance that this technology can be controlled even in the face of repeated human error and equipment malfunction potentially costing the lives of millions .\nGusterson discusses profit mostly as it pertains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ritual of \u201c initiation and transcendence \u201d involved in creation and testing .\nGusterson \u2019 s use of religiously-tinged language in describing the drives of nuclear scientists is no accident and neither is his title .\nThe allusions evoke the juncture of science and religion or scientism , a type of modern tribalism which equates uncomfortably with totalitarianism as discussed in Part 3 .\nIt might sound counter-intuitive to accuse certain scientists and science collectives of religiosity .\nAnother statistic that must have come up in a few industrial boardrooms when designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ % of members of the National Academy of Sciences are professed atheists and 41 % of those in the professional sciences in the US claim to be as well\u2014vastly higher rates than among non-scientists .\nBut just as self-identification as liberal does not always equate to support for policies that actually benefit the poor , atheist self-identification may also be self-deceptive .\nAs mid-twentieth century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr warns in The Irony of American History and in The Children of Darkness and the Children of Light , when the state and science attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this invariably leads to the use of power without scruples under an illusion that a particular \u201c conception of an unambiguously ideal end \u201d justifies such abuse : \u201c As politics deals with the proximate ends of life , and religion deals with ultimate ones , it is always a source of illusion when the one is invested with the other\u2026This unification is spurious and dangerous ; but this in fact adds to , rather than detracts from , its striking power .\nReligion and science are combined in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought completely into the service of an existential faith.\n\u201d To the extent that corrupt industries and captured regulators generally rely on scientists to play the role of front line defenders of the use of power without scruples\u2014to cover the collateral , hide or alter data , front for ghost studies , etc.\u2014 scientists themselves may be the key targets of evangelism for this existential faith .\nAnd to the extent that science has been labeled progressive and religion is generally regarded as conservative , astroturf groups have squared off against religion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PR doctrine , to create a false binary \u201c us and them \u201d battle model , and to use the glaring flaws in institutional religion to divert attention from front groups \u2019 and their industry sponsors \u2019 cultish , Utopian core of scientism .\nIn general , the corporate world has always maintained an uneasy relationship with religious cultures to the degree that these might , at any moment , enter a humanitarian paradigm shift that could mobilize followers against industrial interests more quickly than any other social force .\nFor this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if religious communities are not embedded corporate allies ( as many modern churches are ) , they are rivals and critics to be feared and war will be declared .\nA relatively recent example of a religious paradigm shift leading to actual war was the US covert campaign to replace pro-labor leaders in Latin America with corporate-friendly puppet dictatorships .\nOperation Condor isn \u2019 t generally recognized as a war waged by the US , much less as a religious war , though the roots of it had clear cause according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with MIT \u2019 s Abel Collins , Noam Chomsky explains how this triggered a militarized response by the US in the twentieth century : In 1962 , with Vatican II , Pope John XXIII introduced a very substantial paradigm shift .\nHe tried to restore the Gospels to the Church .\nThey \u2019 d been essentially eliminated except in form since the 4th century , when the Roman Empire took over Christianity as its official religion .\nThis was a major change .\nAnd it was picked up in Latin America\u2026 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theology .\nPriests , nuns , lay people went out to talk to peasants and set up groups in which\u2026 peasants would read the Gospels , think about their radical pacifist message .\nThere \u2019 s a reason Christians were persecuted for the first three centuries .\nGospels is a radical text\u2026 with its basic preferential option for the poor .\nThey tried to restore it .\nAnd what happened ?\nWell , the U.S. went to war\u2014fought a bitter , brutal , violent war against the church .\nIf we had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they \u2019 d present it .\nThere was a long list of religious martyrs ( points to depiction of Archbishop Oscar Romero ) , overthrow of governments , institution of neo-Nazi-style dictatorships\u2026 Major war against the Church which ended in 1989 with the assassinations of six leading Jesuit intellectuals by a\u2026 U.S.-backed , U.S.-trained , U.S.-armed battalion in El Salvador which had just come from renewed training at the Kennedy school of counterinsurgency warfare and acting on official orders of Salvadoran command very close to the U.S. embassy .\nI don \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , it accepts this .\nThe School of the Americas , which trains Latin American officers\u2014killers basically\u2026 one of its talking points is that the U.S. army defeated liberation theology .\nCollins might have been a bit optimistic when he wrote in Huffington Post that liberation theology is something which the current Pope Francis is dangerously reinvoking with his Evengelii Guadium or \u201c Joy of the Gospel \u201d : The thirst for power and possessions knows no limits .\nIn this system , which tends to devour everything which stands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile , like the environment , is defenseless before the interests of a deified market , which become the only rule\u2026 It will be interesting to see if Pope Francis lives up to his egalitarian words , though the Vatican Radio \u2019 s recent and highly impolitic support of Kenyan Bishops \u2019 charge that the WHO , UNICEF and the Gates Foundation dispensed abortifacient vaccines to Kenyan women illustrates why corporate globalists tend to be wary of such a shift .\nFor many decades , Africa has also been a center of liberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American civil rights movement and the current racial justice movement in the US .\nCivil rights activist , political philosopher and academic theologian Cornel West writes in The Cornel West Reader , Liberation Theology at its best is a worldly theology\u2014a theology that not only opens our eyes to the social misery of the world , but also teaches us better how to understand and transform it .\nAcademic theology in the First World , true to its priestly role , remains preoccupied with doctrinal precision and epistemological pretension .\nIt either refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly and messy affairs of contemporary politics and pontificates at a comfortable distance about the shortcomings and theoretical formulations and practical proposals of liberation theologians .\nYet for Christians deeply enmeshed in and united with poor people \u2019 s struggles , theology is first and foremost concerned with urgent issues of life and death , especially the circumstances that dictate who lives and who dies .\nWest goes on to describe how Latin American schools of liberation theology study the clash between socialism and neoliberal \u201c free market \u201d economic ideology as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s violent covert policies towards Latin America , which\u2014as mentioned in Part 4 of this series\u2014 political media analyst Noam Chomsky describes as distinctly panoptic : To borrow Henry Kissinger \u2019 s terminology , independent nationalism is a \u201c virus \u201d that might \u201c spread contagion.\n\u201d Kissinger was referring to Salvador Allende \u2019 s Chile .\nThe virus was the idea that there might be a parliamentary path towards some kind of socialist democracy .\nThe way to deal with such a threat is to destroy the virus and to inoculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by imposing murderous national security states .\nThat was achieved in the case of Chile , but it is important to recognize that the thinking holds worldwide .\nIn short , liberation theology is the juncture at which a modern cultural perception flips poles and does a 180 .\nIt \u2019 s the place where religion becomes lefty\u2014why priests and nuns were targeted by death squads as \u201c socialists \u201d ( read : nationalist , anti-imperialist , anti-corporocratic ) during the last century \u2019 s American sponsored Latin American reigns of terror\u2014and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalists seeking to oust foreign mineral investors are also guided by it .\nIn the documentary film Blood Coltan , Father Jean Bosco Bahala , a leader in liberation theology and a leading critic in the blood trade of coltan , states , \u201c It \u2019 s as if by giving us natural resources , the Lord has trapped us , because other people come and take them from us .\nAnd instead of improving our lives , they have made us much more unhappy.\n\u201d From the pulpit , Bosco regularly exhorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to foreign imperialists and works to stop the violence and ritual rapes\u2014 of women , children , infants , even the elderly\u2014 used to bring the population to its knees in service of transnational industry .\nAs part of his liberation doctrine , Bosco personally documents the crimes committed against the population in the name of trade .\nIn kind , the Kenyan bishops who , again , stood up against their own government , the WHO , Unicef and the Gates Foundation , to denounce the latest mass sterilization campaign described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liberation theology , which is again becoming a problem for corporate globalization .\nVirtually all world religions contain similar ranges of scripture from which such organized resistance to corporate hegemony could be launched .\nThe real threat of religious culture to corporate interests is not if these various faiths remain in corrupt , cult-like retrograde or calcified states which are easy to take shots at , like clergy sex abuse scandals or religious violence .\nCorruption is also easy to control : during Operation Condor , the Latin American church was split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juntas for gain or safety .\nHistorically , the most potent threat is if these religions refocus on texts which are foundationally supportive of nonviolent social justice because of the greater persuasive and revolutionary power of it and because when it does not take the form of a cult , faith based social justice can be inclusive of all faith and non-faith instead of self-limiting and such a movement may snowball .\nThis is the real target .\nReligion is not the only social force capable of moving masses .\nMany non-faith-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this isn \u2019 t an argument for the ultimate value of religion over secularism which both have reformist potential .\nIt \u2019 s just a note on history : faith-based movements , for better or worse depending on perspective and circumstances , are frequently powerful and overpowering .\nThis is precisely why an existential corporate faith\u2014 complete with scriptural slogans and propaganda\u2014 is being fabricated to supplant them .\nPart 10 will look further into the use of false humanism as a cover for globalization .\nAdriana Gamondes is a Contributing Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blog \u2019 s Facebook

suggesting that an infant would be able to receive safely thousands of vaccine products in one go without harm [ 7 ] , which should not perhaps have reflected well on their judgment .\nThe opposite of side the coin is insouciant denial of any harm at all : it may be that the Department of Works and Pensions has recently been forced by the Court of Appeal to make payments in some Pandemrix/narcolepsy cases having adopted a Catch 22 approach claiming that long term damage could not be assessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point payments had dried up altogether for several years , despite the endless expansion of the programme [ 9 ] .\nIn the case of Pandemrix and narcolepsy the MHRA and the EMA failed to pick up signals despite there being a great many [ 10 ] .\nIn the general case of vaccines and autism , even if the MHRA paid attention to initial adverse events they would have no machinery to follow up on long term developmental problems : the enduring system is in fact designed not to pick them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively monitor vaccine adverse events and their sequelae the DHSC is not even in a position to say that they are rare .\nGiven , for instance , the current debate over HPV vaccines [ 11,12,13 ] what are the ethical grounds for not warning the public of failures , or even continuing to license the products ?\nBy a coincidence the 2017 Mental Health Survey for Children and Young People in England [ 14 ] was published the day after I wrote to you .\nI raise an eyebrow at your suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the survey also deserves to be taken much less seriously than the recent Northern Ireland census [ 15,16 ] where there was a proper attempt to count all the cases rather than project numbers from a tiny sample .\nIt is possible that there may have been a few more fringe diagnoses in the 2.9 rate recorded compared with 1.2 % 9 years before , but nevertheless Stage 5 diagnoses had all but doubled between 2008-9 and 2017-8 , from 0.89 to 1.74 % , which makes 1 in 57 children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given innumerable media reports of the system breaking down , and many new facilities having to be provided across the entire United Kingdom this seems to be much more likely to be representative than the results of the new survey [ 17,18 , 19,20 ] .\nAccording to a recent report the number of young people with learning disabilities held in unsuitable conditions in short term assessment units ( but not necessarily for a short stay ) has doubled to 2,375 cases in the last three years [ 21 ] .\nA Haringey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 ] states that the number of adults requiring support with learning disability is set to have risen from 556 in 2013 to 1,147 in 2022 \u2013 if the trend continues it looks like it will completely have overtaken the elderly by the later 2020s , but these are cases which unlike the elderly will have a lifetime of dependency ahead of them .\nBearing in mind the huge and increasing budgetary constraints on local authorities , it seems improbable that their criteria for recognising new cases has become more lenient .\nNor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much different from those in Haringey I have cited .\nSince each case is set to cost the state and more importantly the public millions of pounds , they really ought to be properly counted .\nI fear we also need to return to the old data .\nIn the 1999 schools \u2019 mental health survey the PDD rate among secondary school children born between 1984 and 1988 was 1 in 500 compared with 1 in 250 in primary school [ 23 ] , but by the 2004 survey when virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MMR generation the figure had risen to virtually 1 in 100 across the board [ 24 ] .\nAlready in that period some of us were exercised over claims that any of this was at all normal but now if we look at what was written at the time we are still looking at relatively modest figures .\nFor instance , Gillberg and Wing wrote in relation to the rising trend in 1999 [ 25 ] : \u201c The early studies yielded prevalence rates of under 0.5 in 1000 children , whereas the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1 in 1000 .\nThere was a marked difference in prevalence rates between those studies that included some children born before 1970 ( low rates ) and those that included only children born in 1970 and after ( high rates ) .\nThis is probably due to the lower rates obtained by use of criteria strictly based on Kanner 's description of his syndrome.\n\u201d Even Eric Fombonne in the same year was talking comparatively small numbers [ 26 ] : \u201c Over 4 million subjects were surveyed ; 1533 subjects with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each study are summarized , including case definition , case-finding procedures , participation rates and precision achieved .\nAcross surveys , the median prevalence estimate was 5.2/10000 .\nHalf the surveys had 95 % confidence intervals consistent with population estimates of 5.4-5.5/10000\u2026Based on recent surveys , a minimum estimate of 18.7/10000 for all forms of pervasive developmental disorders was derived , which outlines the needs in special services for a large group of children.\n\u201d This was one of the papers that the DHSC sent to reassure me when I first expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 .\nBut this is a whole order of magnitude different from the current situation , while attempts to locate the missing numbers ( as opposed to the occasional case ) in a population now over the age of 30 have signally failed .\nIn 2013 , in contrast to National Autistic Society projections , of 700,000 cases across the entire population the DWP knew of only 129,000 who were likely preponderantly minors [ 27 ] .\nBrugha \u2019 s figure for adults in 2009 was extravagantly extrapolated , based on flawed diagnostic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow missed nearly 3/4s of the cases before weighting , and was downgraded by National Statistics to the status of \u201c experimental statistics \u201d in 2016 [ 28 ] , while his 2014 data was published in 2016 as only \u201c experimental statistics \u201d [ 29 ] .\nThe \u201c they must be there somewhere \u201d line has been playing for two decades without the cases ever being found .\nBut if they were there , they would be a massively dependent and expensive population and they would not have to be looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn is that while the DHSC has for two decades been trying dispel the notion that autism is rising ( and perhaps believing it themselves ) , a steady trickle of cases has turned into a stream , has turned into a flood .\nTwenty years ago , the rate was 5 in 10,000 , 10 in 10,000 , just possibly 20 in 10,000 but now it is 290 in 10,000 and going up .\nThe rhetoric of \u201c more recognition \u201d continues ( has been very effective as a public relations strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the same thing .\nThese costs will inevitably eclipse that of the care of the elderly , if they have not already .\nAnd the question is very much why as this population catastrophe has unfolded - at immeasurable financial cost to the nation , immeasurable personal cost to huge numbers of citizens - has the DHSC just stood by year after year telling everyone that nothing is happening ?\nIf the rise is real \u2013 and the hard data tells us it is all too real \u2013 it is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is responsible .\nThe \u201c echo chambers \u201d of social media are as nothing compared with the echo chambers of public health .\nIn 2013 you wrote in your Annual Report on another matter [ 30 ] : \u201c In pointing out the lack of evidence for well-being , I have been asked to \u2018 take a leap of faith \u2019 about well-being in mental health .\nAs Chief Medical Officer I will not take a leap of faith with people \u2019 s health .\nThe truth is that well-being in mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much bigger picture , and I recommend that bigger picture to policy makers \u201d .\nYet you continue , as far as I can see , to take the leap of faith on MMR safety and \u201c must be there \u201d adult autism cases .\nThank you very much for letting me know of the \u201c comprehensive Think Autism review \u201d to begin early this year - I have not so far seen any public announcement so that ordinary citizens can give their views .\nMay I also suggest that this correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ] The paper by Brent Taylor and colleagues , Demicheli et al ,

Jackson chastised further on use of the rape analogy , then asked Holland to provide examples of Supreme Court or other rulings dealing specifically with the issue of informed consent and vaccination .\nIt was some time before Holland could continue with her testimony , at which point she discussed the potential denial of public education that would result from instituting such a law , the fact that the laws already in place in all states ensured high vaccination rates as it is , then asked whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !\nWait a minute .\nWait a second ...

knowledge\u2014which dominates our universities\u2014is anti-thought .\nIt precludes all alternatives .\nIt is used to end discussion .\nIt is designed to give to the forces of science or the free market or globalization a veneer of rational discourse , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these forces and trust our fate to them .\nThese forces , the experts assure us , are as unalterable as nature .\nThey will lead us forward .\nTo question them is heresy .\n~ Chris Hedges As for Jackson invoking her position with the Women \u2019 s Caucus , the majority of parents who spoke in opposition to the bill were women and , given the mounting evidence that vaccines do in fact cause neurological and other injuries , there \u2019 s nothing particularly feminist about forcing a technology that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status as many are forced to give up careers to care for catastrophically disabled children into adulthood and beyond .\nAnd as a sexual assault survivor myself , Jackson \u2019 s objection seems completely disconnected from both the issue of rape and the fallout of mandated immunization .\nAlmost 20 years after my own experience with assault , I still walk with a limp and am partly hearing impaired .\nBut I had my day in court with a jury of peers and full due process including discovery , rule of law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I \u2019 ll never see for my vaccine-injured children .\nOtherwise the two experiences are very similar .\nFor cooperating with the prosecution , survivors of rape are regarded in some corners as anti-male .\nFor reporting children \u2019 s vaccine injuries , parents are called anti-vaccine .\nBeing branded extremists for speaking out is par for the course .\nAnd in both situations , injuries are minimized , witness testimony is discredited as \u201c clouded by trauma \u201d and irrational , apologists extol the faultless virtues of perpetrators while bystanders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing or quarantine blame to the victims .\nI can testify to both and to the fact that it \u2019 s far worse when these weapons are aimed at children .\nTo make the parallel darker , one experience doesn \u2019 t necessarily preclude the other since roughly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 6 men will have experienced some form of sexual assault in their lifetimes and , what \u2019 s more , disabled children have a vastly elevated risk of also being sexually assaulted .\nAnd the parallels become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversy .\nFor example , members of the biotech industry PR front discussed in Part 9\u2014a sort of web-age Pinkerton squad known as the organized Skeptics that leads the charge in demonizing vaccine injury claimants , attacking industry whistleblowers and rationalizing repressive domestic and foreign policy\u2014 is suffering from its own internal rape scandal .\nThis was followed by attempts to silence victims using language usually reserved for attacks on consumer activists , then followed by a sort of table cloth trick within the group to oust the most prominent offenders while still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mentioning the infamous \u201c underage sex tapes \u201d involving Skeptic founder James \u201c The Amazing \u201d Randi which are found on zip files all over the web .\nSkeptic figureheads including Randi also founded the False Memory Syndrome Foundation , an organization that specializes in debunking sexual abuse claims based on controversial theories on memory\u2014both the idea that repressed memory does not exist and that all witness memory is fatally flawed .\nPolitical and crime reporter Steven Elbow covered the controversial history of FMSF and its founders for Capital Times : Pulitzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 article in the Columbia Journalism Review , weighed the impact the False Memory Syndrome Foundation had on the discussion as society began to grapple with the concept of recovered memories .\nAt a time when the media were sensationalizing cases of repressed memory , the foundation stepped in and swung the pendulum the other way .\n`` Rarely has such a strange and little-understood organization had such a profound effect on media coverage of such a controversial matter , '' Stanton wrote .\n`` The foundation is an aggressive , well-financed PR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassing its critics , and mobilizing a diverse army of psychiatrists , outspoken academics , expert defense witnesses , litigious lawyers , Freud bashers , critics of psychotherapy , and devastated parents . ''\nElbow notes that the number of sexual abuse allegations based on the repressed memory of victims tapered off so dramatically as a result of attacks on repressed memory that the False Memory Syndrome Foundation was gradually ceasing to be relevant .\nThe group \u2019 s theories and figures remain an \u201c item \u201d nevertheless , getting recent credulous coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group has expanded its theory for corporate and political exculpation .\nElizabeth Loftus , the star expert witness of FMSF and member of the organization \u2019 s board \u2014 who referred a colleague for the defense of the \u201c Butcher of Treblinka , \u201d John Demjanjuk ( whose first case was won on the theory of \u201c flawed memory \u201d of concentration camp victims ) , and who once testified on behalf of OJ Simpson , the Hillside Stranglers , Ted Bundy , Scooter Libby and two Yugoslav commanders convicted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s testimony and her science were deemed specious and irrelevant in the latter two trials ) \u2014 has acted as a consultant for the CDC .\nIn fact , Loftus was interviewed by Seth Mnookin for his vaccine defense screed , Panic Virus , to disparage witness testimony in vaccine injury claims cases .\nAnd , as it happens , a theory of \u201c false memory \u201d was wielded in Vaccine Court by Special Master George Hastings in the ruling against the Cedillo family \u2019 s vaccine injury case .\nIn Cedillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hastings stated , To be sure , I do not conclude that Mrs. Cedillo was ever , in her affidavits or her hearing testimony , intentionally failing to tell the truth as she remembered it at that time .\nAfter observing her testimony during the evidentiary hearing , I certainly have a favorable impression of her as an honest person .\nIt is simply the case that human memories often become less accurate with the passage of time , especially with respect to emotionally-charged events\u2026 In reality , medical documents showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the court ignored evidence , as if to make Michelle Cedillo \u2019 s medical history fit a predetermined theory on memory originally designed for a parallel purpose -- to shut down testimony of sexual abuse , the mention of which nearly shut down a senate hearing in California .\nBecause Vaccine Court does not operate under the normal rules of civil procedure and has no pre-trial discovery , it may never be known if the Department of Justice consulted with Loftus or other members of the FMSF to fight the Cedillo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flawed memory were used in Cedillo , it would have been despite the fact the DOJ knew perfectly well that the theory has not stood unchallenged , either in court or in clinical literature .\nIn Libby 's `` Plamegate '' trial for instance , the DOJ 's Patrick Fitzgerald tore apart Loftus 's methodology and forced her to admit to the use of altered and flawed data .\nAnd according to Canadian criminologist and domestic abuse expert Donald Dutton\u2014who , like Loftus , also testified as an expert witness in the OJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims of traumatic perpetration tend to have far more accurate recall than perpetrators : Ganley ( 1980 ) has confirmed the tendency of women victims to have comprehensive recall of the battering incident ( since their lives depended on being able to defend themselves ) and of the male batterers to blank it out When I started to collect questionnaire data on abusive men , I found the same issue with fuzzy memories .\n( p. 91 , Dutton , The Domestic Assault of Women : psychological and criminal justice perspectives 2001 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape and death threats against Australian medical choice advocate Meryl Dorey led back to Whyweprotest.net , a fringe hub of the hacktivist group , Anonymous , and then traced to Australian Skeptic Dan Buzzard according to Dorey \u2019 s attorneys .\nIn short , the issue of rape is all over the vaccine mandate and vaccine injury controversy whether Mary Holland had drawn the analogy or not .\nBut regardless , Senator Jackson showed only warm appreciation for the testimony of Skeptic-affiliated law professor and neoliberal maven Dorit Reiss , who incidentally applauds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biotech enforcement , helpfully binding together the themes that so deeply disturbed Jackson when Mary Holland merely made reference to them .\nIt \u2019 s talking about certain issues that appears to be the problem , not the issues themselves .\nThe point of illustrating the parallel is not to make the case that rape culture only exists in certain spheres ; it exists everywhere , but this sphere in particular happens to be emblematic of another parallel\u2014 total lack of accountability for those proximate to power and double standards .\nWhile critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are easily brought down , evangelists for state and institutional policy enjoy relative immunity .\nFor instance , Whyweprotest.net is also where Skeptic mouthpieces like Buzzard and others have campaigned to make institutional and industrial platforms like compulsory medicine and state child removal as a tool of biotech enforcement seem somehow in keeping with Wikileaks \u2019 platform of corporate and state transparency in a clear attempt to rope hacktivist wannabes into the industrial cause .\nAnd while these Skeptic hacktivist entryists have never been properly investigated , Wikileaks \u2019 founder remains imprisoned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape allegations that even the alleged victims have protested .\nIt \u2019 s all particularly curious since hacktivist hubs are deeply infiltrated , leading to a steady stream of prosecutions of Anonymous-affiliated hacktivists .\nAccording to a report by Glenn Greenwald \u2019 s for The Intercept based on a 50-page presentation by the UK \u2019 s GCHQ shared with the NSA and other agencies , British and US intelligence agencies are employing covert tactics to monitor and subvert an array of online activist groups .\nAnd all the while , Skeptic figureheads like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in alleged crimes are frequently guest editors or commentators in pop-science and mainstream publications like Scientific American ( also here ) , Discover Magazine , New York Times Magazine , etc .\nand set the tone for public health discourse .\nIt \u2019 s no surprise : case after modern case has shown that rendering service to power provides a degree of indemnity while doing the reverse risks bringing about a full Freudian transference of guilt .\nThe problem with discussing any of it is that the current corporate defense scene is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover-era Underworld USA trilogy : World \u2019 s richest man ( Howard Hughes/Bill Gates ) obsessed with germs and looking to sanitize the world ; shakedown artists and rogue operatives in a mix and match arrangement with racists and/or perverts wielding a Hooverian bio-behaviorist obsession with the genetics of crime and political dissent and programs to contain minorities while everyone glides around in progressive drag under the guise of philanthropic purity .\nAnd they all hate someone named Robert F. Kennedy .\nIt \u2019 s pure neoliberal noir , down to engineering juntas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would believe it ever happened in the first place much less again ?\nAs Ellroy put it in American Tabloid , the

.\nInnocent people were being \u201c disappeared \u201d , their children taken and secretly adopted by members of the military elite .\nFor the same purpose , pregnant women were being detained and then executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were part of a campaign of \u201c societal reprogramming \u201d \u2026 At the time I wrote the article , I didn \u2019 t precisely put two and two together with other contemporary political trends and the neoliberal globalization agenda behind Operation Condor .\nMy sense of `` verisimilitude '' was not that reckless , so I had no idea how the analogy would incrementally come to life six years later and how so many families would begin seriously discussing leaving the country out of fear their children may be literally \u201c disappeared.\n\u201d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families for failure to vaccinate , despite various state guidelines saying that Child Protective Services are not authorized to remove children on these grounds .\nIn view of this nationwide trend and in view of protests against excessive use of police force around the country , municipal violation traps , criminalization of American life , etc.\n, Senator Jackson \u2019 s outrage at Mary Holland \u2019 s rhetorical references to enforcement is bleakly absurd .\nThe question haunting many is what the connection may be between all these various disasters from the epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the explosion in private prisons , arrests of disabled children on school grounds , state child snatching , the destruction of education , incursions on civil and consumer rights , drones , torture , deregulation , surveillance , economic crashes and ecological damage\u2014the list goes on .\nTom Englehardt of TomDispatch claims he doesn \u2019 t have a name for it , though he frames the issue neatly nevertheless : Though the marriage of the state and the corporation has a pre-history , the full-scale arrival of the warrior corporation only occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly be seen as a seminal moment in the formation of whatever may be coming in this country .\nOnly 13 years later , there is no part of the war state that has not experienced major forms of privatization .\nThe U.S. military could no longer go to war without its crony corporations doing KP and guard duty , delivering the mail , building the bases , and being involved in just about all of its activities , including training the militaries of foreign allies and even fighting .\nSuch warrior corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national security state , including torture , drone strikes , and -- to the tune of hundreds of thousands of contract employees like Edward Snowden -- intelligence gathering and spying .\nYou name it and , in these years , it \u2019 s been at least partly privatized .\nAll you have to do is read reporter James Risen \u2019 s recent book , Pay Any Price , on how the global war on terror was fought in Washington , and you know that privatization has brought something else with it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the system for profits of a sort that might normally be associated with a typical third-world kleptocracy .\nAnd all of this , a new world being born , was reflected in a tiny way in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s very personal decision about her emails .\nThough it \u2019 s a subject I know so much less about , this kind of privatization ( and the corruption that goes with it ) is undoubtedly underway in the non-war-making , non-security-projecting part of the American state as well .\nMore than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spate of international \u201c free trade \u201d deals , \u201c the major tendency is towards transfer of power to private tyranny and away from the public sphere\u2026 It \u2019 s happening in different countries at different rates , it \u2019 s happening internationally , and I think that \u2019 s going to be very harmful to values that we ought to share , like democracy.\n\u201d What \u201c it \u201d is is neoliberal globalization .\nIt 's what 's driven so much violent corporate adventurism abroad and it 's now coming home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have predicted it would , since these markets can not expand outward forever .\nFor clarification , the definition of globalization varies from source to source .\nLike Englehardt , I \u2019 m still trying to wrap my head around it .\nFor instance , the Wikipedia entry for \u201c Globalization \u201d describes it in almost entirely positive if completely snooze-worthy terms .\nWikipedia employs economic meta-terminology mingled with kinder-gentler references to connections between human beings around the world .\nWikipedia pretends , as do most corporatized media , that neoliberal globalization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not .\nFor the purposes of this article , \u201c globalization \u201d is a reference is to the mature form of unfettered monopoly corporatocracy on a global scale which relies on international treaties using acronyms such as NAFTA , AFTA , CEFTA , CISFTA , COMESA , GAFTA , GCC , SAFTA , SICA , TPP , and MEFTA .\nThese so-called free-trade treaties promote globalization with a neoliberal agenda to hand democratic functions of sovereign countries to private corporations which naturally seek to minimize regulations that inhibit profits and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on the \u201c free market \u201d mantra of both neoliberalism and neoconservatism\u2014though laissez-faire capitalism is not new and is neither \u201c liberal \u201d nor \u201c conservative \u201d but an old form of economic radicalism .\nBritish economist Adam Smith is often misleadingly held up as an icon of this economic view , though Smith himself warned in 1776 , \u201c All for ourselves , and nothing for other people , seems , in every age of the world , to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind.\n\u201d Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also intended as a \u201c better world \u201d exercise , not necessarily possible in reality .\nBut the point is moot since there \u2019 s nothing actually \u201c free \u201d or even laissez-faire about an oligopoly favoring corporations or financial institutions that pay off politicians and result in no-bid government contracts .\nThere \u2019 s nothing \u201c free \u201d about a population that lives under a system where these corporations buy favorable legislation .\nThere \u2019 s nothing liberating about the fact that 80 % of the National Security Agency is run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It represents the blowback of hegemony and , in a domestic sense , a type of foreign invasion .\nUnder globalization , domestic law is supplanted by international treaties largely created by international corporations .\nWith the Trans Pacific Partnership , a treaty being convened in secret and pushed for fast track authorization to avoid public input , more Americans might at last start to feel the pain formerly reserved for the working classes and foreign losers of the trade treaty game .\nThe Trans Pacific Partnership may even explain the mad rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been leaked about the document demonstrates that , once ratified , corporations could sue states that attempt to alter existing legislation in ways that could \u201c harm future corporate profits.\n\u201d So in theory , if personal vaccine exemptions no longer exist by the time the treaty passes , they could not be reinstated .\nAccording to documents leaked by Wikileaks , there may be something worse in the works\u2014TISA or the Trade in Service Agreement : TISA is a controversial global trade agreement which brings with it concerns that it will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit across borders with impunity .\nThis global trade agreement , promoted by the United States and the European Union , covers 50 countries and is being opposed by anti-globalization activists and global trade unions .\nThe TISA deal is expected to promote privatization of public services in countries across the world , and ease regulations in other sectors .\nEven without TPP or TISA , the trend has already led to a domestic push for privatization/liberalization of schools , social security , pension plans , health care , utilities , military , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster relief , and police .\nIn any event , the various barriers that protect local business , banks , workers , unions , citizens and the environment are being removed and , once privatized , these institutions become immune to Freedom of Information Act requests and are no longer accountable to the public .\nAnd as each institution is corrupted , it can be more easily bent to serve other wings of the assault , demonstrated by the militarization of public health and its use as cover for foreign exploits or domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is corruption other than the larval stage of privatization ?\nConsequently , there have been discussions of privatizing the CDC .\nIt \u2019 s easy to extend that model to corporate power over state and federal legislation on environment , medicine and everything else .\nIn the NAFTA treaty , for example , there are 900 pages of clauses , most of which seek to override various national environmental , safety , drug , labor , commerce , and tariff laws .\nNAFTA sets up its own treaty-court system to accomplish this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain privatization is a short documentary on Halliburton \u2019 s conduct during the war in Iraq .\nIt \u2019 s also not much of a stretch to see how this is relevant to vaccine mandates and autism .\nAfter discussing the privatization of public schools with one of the teachers who participated in the mass walk out in Oklahoma to protest Common Core , we hatched a few tentative theories .\nDrawing from the Halliburton model , it might appear that the autism epidemic and other explosions in childhood chronic disease and disability\u2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mainstream drugs , screening and treatment\u2014 have been so instrumental to the campaign to privatize/Halliburtonize public education in the US that it may disincentivize finding a cause for autism and ending the epidemic .\nAccording to Dianne Ravitch , author of Reign of Error and one of the chief critics of Common Core , in order for public education to need \u201c rescuing \u201d by private industry , first it had to start failing .\nAs public money is dispersed , so is public oversight and accountability for the spending of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of a powerful executive who is immune to public opinion .\nThey like the idea of a governor who appoints a commission to override the decisions of local school boards that resist charter schools .\nThey like the idea of a superintendent at the state level who has unlimited power to impose his ( their ) policies\u2026Corporate reformers don \u2019 t like checks and balances .\nThey want executives who can ignore the protests of parents , students , teachers and community leaders , no matter how loudly they complain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public hearings or protest at rallies .\nMuch of the engineered failure of public schools was achieved through defunding .\nBut as many in the environmental autism arena have brought up , another likely reason for the plummeting global ranking of American secondary education might have to do with the plummeting health status of public school children\u2014 1 in 6 with cognitive diagnoses , 1 in 6 with severe allergies , 1 in 12 with asthma , 1 in 68 with autism , etc .\nWithout discussing the reasons for rising rates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits the epidemic has had for the privatization crusade : Jonathan Pelto reports that 70 % of students will fail the Common Core test called Smarter Balanced Assessment ( SBAC ) ; the tests were designed to \u201c fail \u201d 70 % of students , as is the PARCC test .\nBoth Common Core tests are aligned with the \u201c cut scores \u201d ( passing marks ) of the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) .\nNAEP \u201c proficient \u201d is set very high ; Massachusetts is the only state where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAEP .\nPelto points out that 90 % of students with special needs are expected to fail SBAC .\nIt may not be incidental that rates of all these conditions are far lower in , for example , Finland\u2014the country that holds the # 1 spot for secondary education in the world .\nFinland also has far better child mortality ranking , a far lower rate of autism and a voluntary vaccination program with roughly 1/3 the number of vaccine doses recommended for birth to 18 .\nAlso according to Ravitch , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charter school push in the US , several are very familiar within the vaccine safety/autism arena : Bill Gates , Rupert Murdoch , the Koch Brothers .\nAll either own or control publications that push compulsory vaccination and orchestrate attacks on safety critics .\nAll have been able to use failing public education in the US as an entering wedge to argue that government can not be entrusted with the task and that , on the \u201c free market \u201d credo , private corporations must now come in and rescue the system using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is Common Core and the \u201c testocracy.\n\u201d As with vaccine mandate campaigns , public resistance has exposed the anti-democratic face of the high priests of corporate progress : Secretary of Education Arnie Duncan now threatens to turn to force if students continue to opt out of endless testing .\nAnd as with Mary Holland 's rhetorical inquiry in her testimony before the California Senate Judiciary Committee , we 're not meant to ask what that force might entail but this is also not hard to guess .\nThe privatization trap has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is ready to spring : the infamous bill mill , the American Legislative Exchange Council or ALEC\u2014which is behind Common Core as well as prison privatization and includes past and present members such as Microsoft , Murdoch 's News Corp. , and Koch industries\u2013 has worked for years to privatize foster care , adoption and child protective services , making state child removal a for-profit industry and arguably resulting in children being taken for increasingly trivial causes .\nAs a side note , something else Holland would not have been allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of sexual abuse in state care is 8-fold that of the worst homes in the US and the risk of death is five times greater .\nBoth the privatization of this system and the way that the privatization of other systems is feeding it have only made the situation worse .\ncomes to mind As another side note , it \u2019 s a common mistake to assume school privatization equates to \u201c private schools \u201d when it 's really more along the lines of \u201c Monsanto High , \u201d \u201c Microsoft Elementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School.\n\u201d One can only imagine what curriculum would be like in that final phase , though Bill Gates \u2019 pet concept of teaching \u201c Big History \u201d has already been equated to `` historicism \u201d \u2014the mystical , tribal ideological basis of totalitarianism outlined in Part 3 .\nAccording to political philosopher Karl Popper , historicism refers to the mythical \u201c laws of history which enable [ rulers ] to prophesy the course of historical events , \u201d a type of trickery that Popper contends is partly motivated by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events are bound to happen make propaganda for them , and help to bring them about '' \u2014 bringing to mind Gates ' disturbingly specific pronouncement in Berlin that a global pandemic equivalent to the Spanish flu may strike humanity within a year .\nIt \u2019 s not reassuring that , as mentioned throughout the series , Gates \u2019 globalization schemes appear to be suspiciously meshed with the use of medical philanthropy as cover for military and intelligence missions , surveillance and coordinated assaults on domestic consumer activists .\nGates concluded his Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the coming plague and against `` anti-vaccine '' views as if \u201c preparing for war.\n\u201d To the extent that groups like Anonymous are frequently involved in consumer and environmental causes and in light of government targeting of nonviolent Occupy activists on behalf of international corporate clients , it \u2019 s clear those who resist corporate policy are interchangeable with enemies of the state and will receive the same treatment .\nThis in turn illustrates the ties between the globalization process , the war on terror , domestic militarization and increasing incursions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Guardian brings the chilling point home : an extrajudicial \u201c black site \u201d facility has been discovered in Chicago into which detainees are periodically \u201c disappeared.\n\u201d Tracy Siska , a criminologist and civil-rights activist with the Chicago Justice Project , said that Homan Square , as well as the unrelated case of ex-Guant\u00e1namo interrogator and retired Chicago detective Richard Zuley , showed the lines blurring between domestic law enforcement and overseas military operations .\n\u201c The real danger in allowing practices like Guant\u00e1namo or Abu Ghraib is the fact that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siska said .\n\u201c They creep into domestic law enforcement , either with weaponry like with the militarization of police , or interrogation practices .\nThat \u2019 s how we ended up with a black site in Chicago.\n\u201d The implication is that , even if a controlled media fail to inform the citizens of a country about what is done in their name abroad , these populations will eventually learn of the exploits from first hand experience as they \u2019 re eventually subjected to their own state \u2019 s foreign policy medicine\u2014the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state of plague is highly contagious .\nIn some ways , the series is a pathetic attempt to throw a rock at a tank .\nBut even if reports like this are eventually wiped off the web , they would still leave traces and the traces bleed together with other political events and with history .\nAs a growing human rights movement , I think the consumer safety collective has a duty to track the path of the sword that came down on our heads , to account for other victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be next , to be active in pointing out parallel abuses\u2014 the parallel \u201c story within the story \u201d \u2014 beyond simply using them as analogies for our own cause .\nIf we don \u2019 t , if we shirk the controversy ballast , we \u2019 re not much different than those who participate in fraud and coercion to defend their own careers and institutions and blame the collateral .\nThe lie that this isn \u2019 t the case is comforting to some degree , since it pretends that we , as Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pieces of the system that \u2019 s now destroying us .\nIf the cause is ever to succeed , and there \u2019 s no guarantee that it will , we should divest and boycott that machine when possible .\nAt the very least , those serious about rights and ecology should not buy from companies that profit from prison and slave labor , wars of aggression , conflict minerals , repression , environmental devastation and fraud .\nWhen it 's not possible nor wise to fully divest\u2014 such as with public education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these institutions .\nObviously if we want others to work for change and resist participation in things that harm us even when it hurts , we \u2019 ll have to do the same .\nWhat makes it simpler is that , in many cases , it \u2019 s been the same sword cutting through all of us .\nWe \u2019 re connected to the world through these parallels\u2014a more unsettling view of \u201c globalization \u201d from the perspective of those responsible .\nAdriana Gamondes is a

it on , and ran to the front door .\nThe last time we \u2019 d needed the police \u2019 s assistance at home was years ago - when Ronan wandered one very cold , winter night .\nWith my heart pounding through my chest , I peeked through the front door window and was startled .\nStaring back at me was a very young woman .\nI thought I knew everyone on our neighborhood police force\u2013who were all men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest , with POLICE blazoned across it , but couldn \u2019 t make out much else .\nNope , it wasn \u2019 t in the show - it was coming from my house !\nI shot up from under the covers .\nWhen I stood up , I heard the doorbell .\nWhat on earth ?\n?\nI had heard a faint doorbell chime a minute earlier but thought it was part of a show I was watching - some of the people in the show were sitting in the living room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends coming over , so I thought the doorbell I \u2019 d heard were those friends .\n\u201c MOM , the police are at the door .\nThe police .\nThey \u2019 re at our door !\n\u201d she blurted out quickly .\nI had just said goodnight to her , so I was not expecting her to come barreling in my room as loudly or as nervously as she did .\nI had just gotten under the covers .\nI had just opened my laptop .\nI had just started to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger sister knocked loudly on my bedroom door .\nI wasn \u2019 t going to go to sleep yet , but I just needed to be done with the day .\nMy husband had been out of town for a while , and I was exhausted from trying to do all the things for all the people .\nAfter family prayers , and as soon as Ronan was tucked in his bed , I told the kids I needed to go to bed , too .\nAll I wanted to do was get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television .\nKim shared something last week that reminded me of an incident that happened at our house back in March\u2026 Peering through the glass from the outside , the young officer knocked and said , \u201c Police , ma \u2019 am.\n\u201d It was dark , and the front porch light was still off .\nSo I couldn \u2019 t make out much more than the outline of her face .\nFlipping on the light switch on , both of us continued to stare at each other .\nMy first instinct was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It continued to be panic in that moment also .\nWithout thinking , I opened the front door and also the screen door .\nI \u2019 m sure she \u2019 d said who she was , but all I could think to say was , \u201c What \u2019 s going on ?\n?\n\u201d \u201c I \u2019 m looking for Linda .\nWe got a call to check on her\u2026can you tell me , is she okay ?\n\u201d \u201c Linda ?\nWho ?\nWhat ?\n\u201d I asked , very puzzled .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ There \u2019 s no Linda here.\n\u201d My mind raced , who near us would need to be checked on ?\nThen it hit me , \u201c Ma \u2019 am , which house are you looking for ?\n\u201d Looking at her notepad , she shared the address .\nA wave of relief fell over me .\nThen a twinge of frustration .\n\u201c That \u2019 s next door , \u201d I said to the officer .\nPointing to the left of us , I added , \u201c I think you \u2019 ll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized profusely .\nI smiled , accepted the apology and wished her luck .\nThen , I locked the door and quickly went to find Izzy .\nShe \u2019 d stayed out of view of the foyer but stayed close enough to hear the entire conversation .\nShe relaxed her stance the moment we hugged .\nI held her until she was done hugging me .\n\u201c Mom , I was so scared .\nI had no idea why the police would be here .\nI mean , Ronan \u2019 s safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201d Izzy asked with emotion .\n\u201c Honey , I know .\nI couldn \u2019 t understand why either , \u201d I answered her .\nMy husband and my oldest daughter were miles away that night .\nBut both of our first thoughts were not on their whereabouts or of their safety .\nOur first thought was of Ronan .\nHe was under his covers .\nHe hadn \u2019 t had any seizures .\nSo why did the police show up ?\n?\nThat was the question Izzy and I had both thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer at the door .\nIt was so strange .\nIt was so confusing .\nBut when you live parts of your life in a constant state of worry for someone else , that thought is not so strange and not so confusing .\nThings had been so good for Ronan for so long , that the mere presence of this young woman took us both completely by surprise .\nWe hugged one more time .\nBefore letting go , I asked Izzy if she \u2019 d be okay .\n\u201c Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c Go back to bed .\nI \u2019 ll be okay.\n\u201d We \u2019 d both be okay .\nThe adrenaline from those few minutes pounded through our veins long after we retreated to our own bedrooms .\nWhen we had said prayers that evening , Izzy mentioned she had only about an hour of homework yet to do .\nIt would take her several hours for her to complete though .\nEven though earlier I had felt like collapsing after a very long day , I would be wide awake past midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking every impossible thought possible .\nI can never fall right to sleep when that happens .\nSince I was so wide awake , and since it wasn \u2019 t terribly late yet , I texted my sister and our best friend .\nOur best friend is married to a law enforcement officer .\nThis incident rattled me , and I needed my friends \u2019 support .\nI also needed a question answered .\n\u201c So we just had a wrong-house police response .\nScared the ever living poo out of us\u2026it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor \u2019 s ( elderly ) mom.\n\u201d I then shared that I hadn \u2019 t been aware of a new officer on the force , a young woman .\n\u201c ... that scared me even more .\nIs she legit ?\nIt was dark and panic mode set in .\nShe was very polite , then very apologetic .\nI pointed her in the right direction\u2026I am back under the covers ready to start my silly show again.\n\u201d Both my sister and our best friend responded to my text right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head one more time , then asked , \u201c I do think I answered the door incorrectly and would love your husband \u2019 s advice .\nI had to turn on all the inside lights .\nThen I had to turn on the outside light , then I opened the front door .\nShould I have not opened the door ?\nI \u2019 m sure I could 've had the conversation through the front window .\nBut all brain cells left the moment Izzy came walking into my bedroom telling me the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c If you can look out and see the police car , it should be fine.\n\u201d That was the other weird thing - besides the unexpected evening visitor , I couldn \u2019 t see how this young woman got to my house .\nWhen we \u2019 ve needed help from the police , whoever responds has parked right in front of our house .\nI could not see any police vehicles anywhere when I initially peered out the window .\nI couldn \u2019 t see anything because the cruiser was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the next door neighbor \u2019 s house to the right of us .\nIt wasn \u2019 t until I watched the police officer walk up my driveway did I get a view of the car .\nShe had left the blue lights on - but they were a solid blue , not the flashing blue I \u2019 d have expected to see .\nMy friend \u2019 s husband also offered this advice to me if there ever was a next time , \u201c The other option would be to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them know you \u2019 re going to verify that they \u2019 re supposed to be there , and call the police department \u2019 s non-emergency number and verify.\n\u201d I don \u2019 t know if I \u2019 d remember to calmly do that with how nervous I \u2019 d gotten .\nBack in 2012 when I called 9-1-1 when Ronan had wandered , I could barely pick up my phone .\nThere were only 3 numbers that I had to dial , but my hands were shaking so badly it felt like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got ready to write this story , I reached out to my best friend again .\n\u201c Remember that scary night ?\nWell , I \u2019 m going to write about it .\nLet me know if there are any other tips I can add.\n\u201d The advice I received was to , \u201c Ask for their last name and badge number and they shouldn \u2019 t refuse\u2026also many cities have it so that you can text 911 , so you can verify through that as well.\n\u201d Texting 911 !\nI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nAll of the information I received that night back in March and again last week was helpful .\nIt \u2019 s info I never

also known that lower-income families tend to have higher vaccination rates than higher-income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder about vaccination rates because higher-income families tend to vaccinate less , \u201d Hooker said.6 The CDC denies any link between vaccines and autism , but in 2010 , the federal vaccine court conceded that Hannah Poling \u2019 s autism was the result of vaccinations , which \u201c significantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder , which predisposed her to deficits in cellular energy metabolism , and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder.\n\u201d 7 Mitochondrial Disorders and Autism Poling \u2019 s case was the first time the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case due to an underlying mitochondrial disorder .\nIn October 2020 , a scientific review published in Seminars in Pediatric Neurology further outlined evidence that mitochondrial function may be related to autism .\nIt was estimated in 2017 that about 4 % of children with autism could be diagnosed with a definite mitochondrial disease , while other research suggested abnormalities of mitochondrial function could affect up to 80 % of children with autism.8 \u201c Novel abnormalities \u201d in mitochondrial function have been found in children with autism and treatments targeting mitochondrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ketogenic diet , have been found to be beneficial .\nChildren whose autism is rooted in mitochondrial dysfunction will typically have a key set of symptoms that include:9 Fatigability Gastrointestinal disorders Seizures and/or epilepsy Motor delay and/or ataxia and/or muscle weakness Unusual neurodevelopmental regression , including multiple regressions or regression later than commonly associated with ASD The review \u2019 s author , Dr. Richard Frye with Barrow Neurological Institute at Phoenix Children 's Hospital in Arizona , pointed out that mitochondria are \u201c very vulnerable to environmental factors \u201d and a novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the activity of the electron transport chain is significantly increased ... may be associated with environmental exposures.\n\u201d 10 It appears something in the environment is triggering mitochondrial dysfunction in an ever-growing number of children , but the question is what ?\nGlyphosate Exposure a \u2018 Probable Risk Factor \u2019 Stephanie Seneff , a senior research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , has been studying glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup herbicide , for years and believes it \u2019 s a probable risk factor for autism.11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book \u201c Toxic Legacy : How the Weedkiller Glyphosate Is Destroying Our Health and the Environment , \u201d she explained:12 \u201c It 's been a decade of learning everything I could about glyphosate .\nWhen I first heard about it I basically dropped everything else I was doing because I was so confident that I had found the answer to the autism epidemic .\nThat was the thing I was looking for .\nBack in 2012 , I heard a two-hour lecture by Don Huber , and it changed my focus entirely .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very complex disease \u2014 lots of gut problems and mineral issues \u2014 and it all came together with his lecture .\nOvernight I just started poring over all the papers I could find .\nShortly after that I found S\u00e9ralini 's paper , which had not yet been retracted at that time .\nIt was later republished , the paper by S\u00e9ralini , a French toxicologist who had shown that very low doses of glyphosate over the lifespan of a rat could cause a lot of damage .\nHe pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , so it 's a slow kill .\nThis is one thing I emphasize in my book .\nGlyphosate is subtle , and that 's really a huge problem because people do n't [ make the connection ] .\nWe have diabetes , obesity , autism , Alzheimer 's .\nIt 's a long , long list , all the gut problems .\nThe microbes are being very much disturbed by the chronic poisoning with glyphosate , and then the gut becomes a central starting point for many diseases , including neurological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that disruption of the gut , and glyphosate can cause exactly the things that we 're seeing.\n\u201d Seneff believes glyphosate also contributes to and worsens damage caused by vaccines , in part because it binds very efficiently to aluminum used as an adjuvant in certain vaccines .\nIt likely binds strongly to many other toxic metals as well .\nThe theory is that , by being wrapped up with glyphosate molecules , the metals can more easily penetrate various barriers in your body .\nThis is because glyphosate causes these barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blood-brain-barrier , to become more porous .\nAnd , as leaky gut or leaky brain set in , the toxic metals are shuttled across , along with the glyphosate .\nGlyphosate has also been shown to accumulate in the brain , and animal studies show it causes neuro excitotoxicity due to excess glutamate in the brain .\nThis , in turn , \u201c is absolutely connected to autism , \u201d Seneff says.13 In her book , Seneff also discusses the importance of sulfur for optimal health , how sulfate deficiency is connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfate deficiency .\nSignificant Link Between Mercury , Lead and Autism Adding support to the toxic exposures link to autism is a September 2020 meta-analysis , which concluded there is a significant relationship between autism and concentrations of lead and mercury in the body.14 According to the authors , the relationship between mercury and autism is so strong that `` the concentration of mercury can be listed as a pathogenic cause ( disease-causing ) for autism .\n`` 15 Despite being a known neurotrophic toxin , thimerosal , a mercury-based preservative , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been removed from most childhood vaccines , it is still used in some multidose vials , meaning vials that contain more than a single dose of the vaccine .\nA 2017 review article cited several studies linking mercury and autism among its references , noting:16 '' Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) has been demonstrated to be accompanied by distorted metal homeostasis .\nThe degree to which people are affected by the metals seems to be largely influenced by the individual genetic makeup .\nEspecially Hg [ mercury ] exposure has @ @ @ @ @

to make some changes .\nFirst , was to plan my day better .\nNext , was to actually plan a dinner menu each week instead of going by the imaginary one I ignored in my head daily .\nThird , was to follow through .\nAs I tippy toed into making some positive changes , I could see that things were going to be better .\nOur evening schedule was eventually smoother , and I was n't feeling so rushed .\nDinners were plated sooner than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before .\nIn fact , I was able to add some new dishes to the mix !\nNow , before you think I added more work for myself and spent too many hours thinking about what to make , I promise that I did n't flip through tons of cookbooks or scan through hundreds of online recipes to find new meal ideas .\nSince I am a work in progress and admittedly , somewhat lazy in the kitchen , I just threw what I already had in the fridge and freezer into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I forgotten how easy those were ?\n!\nHere are three of those casserole dishes -- all

would guess a 1/8-1/4 tsp of salt and pepper and 1/2 tsp each of garlic , basil and oregano ) Pour red sauce on the meat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the noodles Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the meat and noodles ; stir ingredients To make it a full meal , we serve Super Noodles with a side dish , like a garden salad or with fresh organic green beans or broccoli .\nOne more side makes

to receive great reviews from each of my children the more I served them .\nExtra praise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been good for all of us .\nNote : I originally shared these recipes with family and friends in 2015 .\nDuring the quarantine of 2020 , we not only continued to rotate these meal ideas , Ronan \u2019 s siblings learned how to make the meals ( plus the side dishes ) and rotated making

.\nDepending on the meal\u2014and the preference , we don \u2019 t have to use the gluten-free ingredient ( like the noodles , for instance ) .\nPlanning ahead is loads better than running around like a crazy woman in the kitchen .\nBeing a crazy woman can be fun every now and then .\nBut it 's never fun when the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's worked all day is on his way home , and when something as simple as starting dinner thirty minutes earlier could make for a better transition to our evenings .\nLife can still get in the way , though .\nSo on days that I do get dinner started later than

The British Government, the World Health Organization and the Global Coup of 2020", "content": "Early `` Monday '' publication for UK .\nAs ever , thank you to John Stone .\nBy John Stone In March 2020 the British Government decided to impose lockdown on the determination of the WHO against the advice of its own medical experts including Sir Chris Whitty - the experts then followed the policy , subordinating their judgment to the outside agency .\nThese events anticipated the WHO \u2019 s recent and continuing attempts to formalise global supremacy in health , and demonstrates the arbitrariness and chaos which will inevitably follow I am trying to understand the events of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to a recent Freedom of Information Request .\nWhy and how was it that four days before lockdown was imposed on March 23 the four Chief Medical Officers of the United Kingdom posted a notice on-line announcing that COVID-19 had been downgraded the status of High Consequence Infectious Disease ( HCID ) .\nThis peculiar event has not gone entirely un-noticed but has never really been explained .\nBefore this point the disease named in the document as COVID-19 ( rather than identified as virus SARS-CoV-2 ) - was a \u201c high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very instant our lives , and everyone \u2019 s , were to be irrevocably pitched into turmoil with the denial of civil liberties and most basic human rights , untold economic destruction and chaos , it was no longer so designated .\nIf the disease was no longer \u201c high consequence \u201d there could be absolutely no reason for this high level and prolonged disruption , and yet it was at this precise moment that the inevitability of lockdown started to be promoted , only to be confirmed four days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoning at no point in the past two and a quarter years , whatever actions they took to restrict our lives or coerce us to accept injections of novel products , has the disease been \u201c high consequence \u201d .\nThis anomaly can not I believe be stressed enough : my FOI request produced no new documents but the Department of Health and Social Care drew my attention to a Parliamentary answer by Jo Churchill on November 6 , 2020 to Conservative MP John Redwood ( submitted fully 5 and a half weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four nations public health high consequence infectious disease ( HCID ) group made an interim recommendation in January 2020 to classify COVID-19 as an HCID , based on the information that was available during the very early stages of the outbreak .\nOnce more was known about COVID-19 , United Kingdom public health bodies reviewed the available information against the HCID criteria and noted certain changes .\nThese changes included the increase in information available about mortality rates , which are low overall amongst the general population ; greater clinical awareness ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory test for the virus .\nCOVID-19 has not been considered a HCID in the UK since 19 March 2020 , but this reclassification has not affected the Government \u2019 s response to COVID-19 , which remains a comprehensive national effort .\nSo , the junior minister , Jo Churchill , confirmed that decision was made with due consideration and not because of some expedience : this remained the case on November 6 , 2020 , and remains the case today because whatever the CMOs have said subsequently to the public , notably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not updated this statement .\nWith this in mind let us go back and look at what was said in the statement of March 19 , 2020 : it may be one of those occasions when British government documents are more revealing than most .\nAs of 19 March 2020 , COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease

in particular , more information is available about mortality rates ( low overall ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific and sensitive laboratory test , the availability of which continues to increase .\nThe Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens ( ACDP ) is also of the opinion that COVID-19 should no longer be classified as an HCID .\nThe ACDP were quite clear and in their letter of 13 March

''\nThe research analyzed hundreds of cities and towns .\nWhat did it find ?\n`` We could not observe a mortality reducing effect of vaccination in Dutch municipalities after vaccination booster campaigns .\nWe did find a 4-sigma significant mortality enhancing effect during the two periods of high unexplained excess mortality . ''\nOh , so the data suggests , do n't prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing people .\nUnexplained mortality is also on the rise in many other countries\u2014Australia , England , Wales .\nSo why is Donald Trump 's vaccine doing all of this in other countries ?\nWell , we ca n't be sure , but as Alex Berenson reported on his Substack recently , the Canadian government is seeing a similar problem at huge scale .\nAs of this summer , people who took Donald Trump 's vaccine in the Canadian province of Manitoba are roughly 50 % more likely than the unvaccinated to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to pause , how bad is Donald Trump 's vaccine ?\nSo bad that people who take it are more likely to die of COVID .\nHmm .\nNow we have data from more Canadian provinces , but they seem to be hiding it now .\nOn July 28 , the province of British Columbia announced it would stop reporting the number of deaths that occurred in people who have taken the COVID booster .\nWow .\nWhy is that ?\nDo n't ask .\nYou 're not allowed to .\nOh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Trump crime .\nThe charts are also missing somehow from the Internet archive , which is widely known , of course , as a front for Russian operatives working on behalf of who ?\nDonald Trump , but we do have the most recent available data .\nWhat do those show ?\nWell , they show that 70 % of all deaths in that province occurred in people who are boosted , even though boosted individuals make up just half the province 's population .\nDo the math on that for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be , `` Oh , well , vaccinated and boosted people tend to be older , so of course , they 're dying at a greater rate .\nIt has nothing to do with the shot , '' but then you look deeper .\nYou read , for example , the Lancet article entitled `` Risk of Infection , Hospitalization and Death up to nine months after a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine '' and that piece shows that people over the age of 80 have worse outcomes and by worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths when they 're vaccinated than when they are unvaccinated .\nSo , it turns out when Donald Trump told you , as he did hundreds of times , certainly you must remember this , that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated , it turned out to be exactly the opposite and we 're seeing this in a lot of different places , in a lot of different data sets .\nIn fact , as Kenji Yamamoto wrote in the Journal of Virology , `` The Lancet study showed that immune function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among unvaccinated individuals . ''\nThat sounds like it 's hurting people 's immune system in a profound way .\nAs the Journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology put it after an independent study , `` Vaccination introduces a profound impairment in type one interferon signaling which has diverse adverse consequences to human health . ''\nThat does n't sound good .\nWhat consequences could they be talking about ?\nWell , in July , the German government put out a Tweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every 5,000 COVID shots causes `` serious side effects . ''\nOne in 5,000 .\nReally ?\nThis is a shot that was taken by hundreds of millions of people , including in this country .\nWhat effects are they actually talking about ?\nWell , those would include decreased sperm counts .\nThe journal Andrology reported in June that there was a 22 % average drop in total sperm count in samples taken 3 to 5 months after the second Pfizer dose of the vaccine , Donald Trump 's vax .\nOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflammation , myocarditis , which is now suddenly famous in neighborhoods across the country because everyone seems to know someone else 's son who has it .\nIn December of last year , researchers at Oxford found that , `` myocarditis risk was increased during 1 to 28 days following a third dose of the vaccine .\nAssociations were strongest in males younger than 40 years for all vaccine types , '' but you knew that because you 're seeing it among people you know and no one 's talking about it .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but now we can because Trump did it .\nResearchers in Israel , meanwhile , found that vaccination increased the 42-day risk of myocarditis by a factor of three .\nIt 's a very serious heart condition , not a small finding .\nNow , you may have also noticed the rise in young athletes dying of heart attacks in recent months , something you 're not allowed to notice , but you probably ca n't help yourself .\nFor example , a 37-year-old cycling champion in Scotland called Rab Wardell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after winning a national mountain biking championship .\nCa n't say he was out of shape .\nMaybe it was n't vax related .\nHave you seen that a lot before ?\nHmm and then there are those five doctors you may have read about in Toronto who died in the same month in July .\nNow , of that group of five dead physicians , there was a 27-year-old triathlete who died after a swimming competition and a 50-year-old Olympian who died after a run .\nSo , these are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking weed and eating Doritos .\nNow , we ca n't know why all of this happened , but the point is we 're allowed to notice now , and that 's significant , especially since some places are still forcing children to take the vaccine and that would include most colleges in the United States .\nThey just announced that boosters are mandatory .\nIn the District of Columbia , which is falling apart , the mayor has decided , she declared this today , that unvaccinated students will not be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get virtual learning unless they take a vaccine , Donald Trump 's vaccine , that appears to be hurting a lot of people , but unless they take it , they will get no education whatsoever .\nHmm .\nWho knew that Muriel Bowser , the resolutely partisan Democrat who runs Washington , D.C. , was actually working for Donald Trump , but she appears to be .\nAt least you know who to blame .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/708418304/0/ageofautism.html", "published": "2022-08-29T06:00:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1661767200, "collection_utc": 1661810497}, {"id": "ageofautism--2022-08-02--Lawyers & Laypersons: Register for IPAK Course on How Uncle Same Removed Vaccine Product Liability F", "date": "2022-08-02", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Lawyers & Laypersons: Register for IPAK Course on How Uncle Same Removed Vaccine Product Liability For Pharma", "content": "If you or a loved one is injured by a vaccine , you can not sue the manufacturer .\nWe need you to know about this 15 week University level course from IPAK in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program used for emergency authorized biologics .\nScroll Down to read the course description and register here .\nIn this course , students will learn the structure , function and defects of the programs in the US created by Congress to award compensation to adults and children potentially and actually harmed or killed by vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important topics , review case histories .\nThis course is for parents and lawyers new to US vaccine injury compensation programs .\nTaught by Wayne Rohde , author of Vaccine Court , this class is available through James Lyons Weiler 's organization , IPAK-EDU .\nMany of us KNOW what these programs are -

Treacherous Path: CA State Agency Failing People with All Disabilities", "content": "California \u2019 s Department of Developmental Services filed a competing petition .\nThe department said that DDS should be Andrew \u2019 s conservator because of alleged abuse by his parents .\nThe judge followed the agency \u2019 s recommendation and Andrew \u2019 s parents were shut out of his care .\nBut when she and her husband petitioned the court to become Andrew \u2019 s conservators , they got a nasty surprise .\nWhen he turned 18 , his mother was advised to seek a conservatorship for him .\nThat \u2019 s a way for someone to assume legal guardianship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .\nBeing his conservator would allow her to make medical decisions on his behalf , along with other choices regarding his care .\nDeborah Findley \u2019 s son , Andrew , grew up with serious health problems , including autism , Lyme disease , and other conditions .\nNow 21 , he is severely disabled and requires

have been unable to visit Andrew in person for over three years , sometimes not even knowing where he was located .\nThere appears to be no legal avenue to challenge the court \u2019 s decision .\nDeborah says she has spent over $ 300,000 in legal fees fighting the state \u2019 s court-ordered conservatorship , trying to get access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s had no luck .\nThe issue of conservatorship is a complex one .\nYou may remember news reports about pop star Brittany Spears and her years-long fight to regain control of her finances and personal life .\nA judge finally ended her 13-year conservatorship in 2021 .\nInvestigative reporter Andie Judson , of ABC10 TV in Sacramento , examines Andrew \u2019 s case in a multi-part news series on conservatorship called \u201c The Price of Care.\n\u201d It is a complicated story with chilling implications .\nAndie Judson : The state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Findley see her son , Andrew , in person .\n\u2026She has spent over $ 300,000 in legal fees fighting the state order conservatorship\u2026 .\nDeborah Findley : \u2026The calls now are restricted to twice a week , 30 minutes .\nJudson : She says she has to follow visitation guidelines .\nQuestions like how he \u2019 s feeling are called \u201c triggering \u201d and put her future visits in jeopardy .\nFindley : Over the past three years , I \u2019 ve only been allowed less than a hundred hours of contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him questions , she shows him his favorite things , like his presents .\n\u2026Christmas is just a few weeks away , but Andrew is not allowed to come home for the holiday .\n\u2026She \u2019 s also not allowed to record visits , so we filmed her side , redacting her son \u2019 s face and voice .\n\u2026Andrew , now 21 , was hard to understand , losing focus often .\nShe says he \u2019 s on many medications that she \u2019 s opposed to .\nBecause of the conservatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : He used to be fully conversational , and he \u2019 s just a shell of a human being right now .\nJudson : This was not what she was expecting when she sought conservatorship nearly four years ago .\nFindley : You \u2019 re told , you know , when your special needs child turns 18 , you need to get conservatorship .\nJudson : Experts we spoke with said there \u2019 s a pipeline that leads to conservatorship starting through school , doctors or regional centers .\nFindley : The regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .\nJudson : Andrew has autism as well as other health conditions requiring that he has around the clock care .\nFindley : Court records show he had some challenges , but you know we have the best therapists in northern California , the best of everything .\nJudson : They thought they could continue this care with the conservatorship .\nShe says they were blindsided .\nFindley : It was pretty much a done deal .\nJudson : In reality , the court was in control .\nFindley : We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen .\nJudson : What the court received , along with Deborah \u2019 s petition for conservatorship , was a competing one from the [ California ] Department of Developmental Services , which is known as DDS , saying that they should be conservator because Andrew \u2019 s were allegedly abusive .\nDDS has continued to say that throughout Andrew \u2019 s life , his parents have interfered with his health , safety and welfare ; that they couldn \u2019 t handle his growing aggression and weren \u2019 t providing proper care .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .\nFindley : A court appointed investigator never interviewed us\u2014still hasn \u2019 t in three years .\nJudson : The court listened to DDS , granting them temporary conservatorship over Andrew in September , 2019 .\nFindley : We become legal strangers to my son , and he was treated like an orphan .\nJudson : Since the conservator process began , Deborah says for periods of time she hasn \u2019 t been told where her son is .\nFindley : It was a lot of nights of crying myself to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son ?\nIs he alive ?\nIs he dead ?\n\u201d I don \u2019 t know .\nNobody would tell us .\nJudson : Seeing people like his mother may cause regression , DDS told the court and that the court should not be swayed by impassioned pleas from family .\nJudson : Information about her son is impossible to get .\nFindley : I \u2019 m like , did he get my card ?\nOh , you have to ask the conservator .\nJudson : Which is a multi-billion dollar state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your son got his Christmas card ?\nDeborah says Andrew wants to come home .\nDDS says this is truly what \u2019 s best for him .\nNow , unlike part one of our investigation , not all of the confidential court documents were accessible for this very complex case , but it gives us a window into a broken system keeping families apart .\nWe wondered how is it that a massive state agency can even serve as conservator over a single person with very specific needs .\nWe asked attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a human rights nonprofit organization .\nTom Coleman : The law permits the director of the Department of Developmental Services to be appointed as a conservator .\nSomeone who \u2019 s running a billion dollar department with hundreds , if not thousands of employees , that person is going to be conservator of an individual and look after their needs and care for them ?\nJudson : DDS often becomes conservator by way of their regional centers .\nJudson : Deborah believes this is a conflict of interest because when a regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s granted , the responsibilities of conservator as returned to the regional center , funded by DDS .\nFindley : DDS is the funding agent .\nThey have full control over how that money is spent .\nJudson : What \u2019 s also funded by DDS are the care facilities where 86 percent of those conserved by DDS live as of July 2022 , like Andrew , as well as Garth who we introduced in part one of our investigation .\nThis is the facility in Lompoc , California where Andrew lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows where he is , she \u2019 s not allowed to visit .\nFindley : Prisoners , they get visitors .\nMy child \u2019 s not allowed any of that .\nJudson : These conservatees care homes as well as care giving expenses as all paid for by taxpayers , yet a June 2022 audit found these facilities are not being properly monitored by DDS or regional centers as state law requires , including medication wasn \u2019 t being properly distributed in some\u2014a life threatening issue .\nThis care is all part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the ongoing legal battles to keep conservatorships in place .\nFindley : The attorney general represents DDS .\nSo there \u2019 s the attorney , there \u2019 s DDS \u2019 s lawyers , there \u2019 s tri-county \u2019 s regional center \u2019 s lawyers .\nJudson : One of those is Andrew \u2019 s own court appointed attorney .\nThe court approved he be paid over $ 13,000 by taxpayers for about 20 days of work , and he \u2019 s just one of the many attorneys involved .\nOthers came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .\nFindley : The assistant attorney general , the two of them .\nTalk about a waste of taxpayer dollars .\nJudson : As a state agency in a court of law , the Department of Developmental Services is represented by California \u2019 s attorney general .\nFindley : It was daunting to be in court with the attorney general .\nJudson : In cases like Deborah \u2019 s , they represent DDS to defend the conservatorship .\nColeman finds this hugely problematic .\nColeman : Because the attorney general of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , including civil rights laws .\nThe State Department of Justice has a civil rights protection division .\nJudson : Protecting and promoting the civil rights of all people in California is this division \u2019 s job , their website says .\nColeman : So the attorney general can intervene when the civil rights of people are being violated .\nWhat if the violator is a state entity , like the Department of Developmental Services ?\nThen the attorney general has a choice .\nYou can \u2019 t a prosecutor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ?\nIt \u2019 s a conflict of interest .\nJudson : We reached out to the attorney general \u2019 s office .\nThey said they won \u2019 t go against state agencies they represent , one being the Department of Developmental Services .\nTo fight a conservatorship , besides spending thousands of dollars for your own attorney , where can you go for help if you \u2019 re in a position like Deborah ?\nWell , under federal law , Disability Rights California is required to protect the rights of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I \u2019 ve reached out to them , I \u2019 ve just been told that they only will communicate with the client , and that my son has to call them and ask them for help .\nJudson : It \u2019 s an organization that represents people with disabilities , and people with disabilities often can \u2019 t communicate the same way that you and I are , and they \u2019 re saying he has to call ?\nJudson : Disability Rights California has a branch called OCRA , standing for Office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This agency is supposed to protect the civil rights of Regional Center clients .\nJudson : But Coleman says OCRA is not helping those conserved .\nColeman : As soon as they hear there \u2019 s a conservatorship involved , they \u2019 re nowhere to be found .\nJudson : And guess who OCRA is funded by ?\nThe Department of Developmental services .\nColeman : I \u2019 ve reviewed their funding ; I \u2019 ve reviewed their contracts with DDS .\nThey have the authority , they have the funding ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we asked Disability Rights , OCRA manager about this .\nShannon Cogan , OCRA manager : I think it \u2019 s really easy to criticize who are doing hard work , instead of collaborating with them .\nJudson : She said with conservatorships , they mainly provide alternatives .\nTheir policy is not to help people obtain a conservatorship .\nCogan : We don \u2019 t have a mandate to file lawsuits or administrative complaints about anything related to conservatorship .\nWe do a lot of good work for people who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They nibble around the edges .\nYou are a law firm .\nYou are a civil rights enforcement legal entity .\nJudson : OCRA \u2019 s own website says that they provide legal advice and representation to clients of Regional Centers , where conservatorships often begin .\nSo we asked if they take on cases to fight conservatorships .\nCogan : Not OCRA .\nThat \u2019 s one of the other branches of the tree .\nJudson : For months we asked OCRA for specifics on how many conservatorship cases this other disability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that data .\nAs for getting involved after a conservatorship happens , Cogan validated Deborah \u2019 s experience : A client must give consent , so Andrew , rather than his mother .\nBut a parent calling could spark action .\nCogan : Certainly if it \u2019 s an issue of extreme rights deprivation , health or safety , we send our employees to that person to interact with them .\nJudson : Tom and Deborah say it \u2019 s not enough .\nColeman : I \u2019 ve had so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights California ; they won \u2019 t do anything , they won \u2019 t do anything .\nJudson : Specifically for Deborah , it seems like a never-ending loop of conflicts of interest .\nThe Regional Center , funded by DDS , recommended DDS be the conservator .\nThey Regional Center then got conservatorship duties and placed her son with a care facility , funded by DDS .\nShe then went to OCRA of Disability Rights California to ask for help , an agency also funded by DDS .\nBut Disability Right California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from representing someone conserved by DDS , like Andrew .\nCogan : We have clients who are conserved by DDS .\nThere \u2019 s no inherent conflict , and we do it .\nJudson : Before our investigation aired we sent DDS this : a three page letter outlining our investigation \u2019 s findings with 15 specific questions , including about conflicts of interest .\nNow they didn \u2019 t answer any of our questions , but they did send us a written statement as well as a video of their director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bargmann video clip : We are constantly looking to improve how we serve the whole person .\nJudson : We decided not to air it in full as they did not allow us to interview them or ask our own questions .\nWe took our questions about DDS \u2019 s budget to Amy Wessling , the executive director of the Association of Regional Center Agencies .\nAmy Wessling : We are the association that represents all 21 of the state \u2019 s Regional Centers .\nJudson : She knows DDS \u2019 s multi-billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : And then this tells you where the money comes from .\nJudson : In addition to fully understanding the budget , we were curious if DDS has an incentive financially to conserve people .\nAmy doesn \u2019 t believe so .\nJudson : But no matter how you look at it , taxpayers are funding DDS conserving people .\n\u2026Parents like Deborah continue to lose hope .\nFindley : Every time I have a call or a visit , I \u2019 m scared it \u2019 s the last one , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again .\nIt \u2019 s just not a way to live .\nJudson : Since our interview , Deborah \u2019 s virtual visitation time has been \u201c paused.\n\u201d Her long legal fight with the Department of Developmental Services will continue in October when the court will determine if DDS \u2019 s conservatorship becomes permanent .\nDeborah has no idea if she \u2019 ll see her son again .\nBut the Department of Developmental Services isn \u2019 t just responsible for the 414 people they \u2019 re conservator to .\nThis 12 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law , is to help ensure 400,000 plus Californians with disabilities have equal rights .\nBut there \u2019 s concern and evidence that they \u2019 re not doing their job .\nCLIP : DDS and their Regional Centers aren \u2019 t really doing a good job of monitoring the quality of those services .\nCLIP : We \u2019 re finding that they \u2019 re just not doing a very good job .\nJudson : That \u2019 s next on The Price of Care .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/711237646/0/ageofautism.html", "published":

little glimpse of what one sibling has experienced as the big sister to someone with autism .\nWhen you take care of someone with special needs , you are never given a how-to guide .\nBooks and guides do exist , but there is never one right way to do it as everyone \u2019 s needs are different .\nLooking up tips on the internet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only go so far .\nI know this because while growing up as a sibling to a brother with autism , it was like learning how to take care of two different lives .\nMy brother Ronan is 19 years old and has low-functioning regressive autism , is non-verbal , and carries with him several other medical diagnoses .\nHe was n't always like this .\nI have memories of him being a typical little brother when I was young .\nIt was just him and I as my other siblings hadn \u2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a vocal toddler , and I remember making him laugh just by putting on a silly face .\nWe would stay up long into the night , while I would make incoherent noises that made him squeal with laughter .\nI know my parents soon regretted putting us in the same bedroom , but I loved being able to make him laugh .\nHowever , my brother today is not the little boy I knew .\nLife has changed much for him as well as for my family .\nWhat worked then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy toddler days are a memory .\nRonan , even though very developmentally delayed , is now considered an adult .\nFar from being able to take care of himself independently , my parents are his legal guardians and I , and my siblings , are secondary caregivers .\nI didn \u2019 t think much of this process when it was happening .\nI was used to taking care of Ronan from time to time , even being employed as a caregiver to him under a respite program my freshman year of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn \u2019 t until I took care of him later , on a school break , did I realize the weight of my new role in his life .\nThis realization came when I was tasked with watching Ronan and two of my siblings for two days .\nMy mom needed to go out of town while my dad was deployed overseas .\nIt \u2019 s safe to say that those two days were the most tiring days of my life .\nFrom keeping up with his medicine schedule to feeding him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I was exhausted .\nI would eagerly await Ronan \u2019 s bedtime just so I could go to bed too , only for him to wake up at 6 am and start his day early .\nThis experience led me to think about two things .\nThe first was that my mom deserves an award for being the strongest woman in the world .\nParents of special needs children are often looked at as always in need of assistance or constantly exhausted .\nI truly don \u2019 t know how my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially with my dad \u2019 s constant deployments .\nThose two days of watching Ronan drained me of energy , I can \u2019 t even imagine doing it for almost 20 years .\nThe second thing I thought about was what would happen if I had to become Ronan \u2019 s official caregiver later on in life .\nI am currently a senior Biology student in college , now at a school far from home , with plans to attend graduate school after graduation .\nI \u2019 ve been forming this plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want my future to take .\nBut Ronan 's needs could potentially change all of that .\nTaking care of him would be a full-time job , and I would probably have to put my life immediately on hold .\nI \u2019 m not going to lie ; this possibility scares me .\nWhen I started to worry about it , I thought I was selfish in wanting to keep my life for myself .\nI \u2019 ve worked so hard to get through college , and I am so excited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to stop it all for Ronan ?\nAt the beginning of July , my dad came home from an almost year-long deployment .\nI was able to join my family in welcoming him home , and we all relished in the fact that this was his last deployment of his military career .\nWhile I was home , I got to see my mom and dad and was again in awe of how they selflessly took care of Ronan .\nThey didn \u2019 t ask for this life of being special-needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role and continue to be the best parents I \u2019 ve ever seen in action .\nI see nothing but unconditional love given to Ronan from my parents and my siblings .\nWe treat him as a brother , as a son , and as a human .\nWe strive to give him the most comfortable and accommodating life , despite his medical afflictions .\nKeeping him safe and cared for is n't something we 'll do for a set amount of time ; it 's something we 'll do indefinitely .\nMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started when he was born , even in our earliest days together as toddlers .\nI am planning on continuing that role for as long as I have to .\nI \u2019 m still able to make Ronan laugh just as hard as when he was a toddler , and I have every intention of keeping him laughing now and for as long as he needs me to .\nI would do anything for Ronan , even if that means stopping my life for his .\nWhile my daughter was not the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll keep it in mind for Ronan 's other siblings when they get into their undergraduate studies .\nCollege is an expensive endeavor , so I am grateful for the thousands of opportunities Fiona has received from other groups over the years .\nWanting to pay her own way as much as possible , she 's pursued and secured several grants and scholarships .\nShe \u2019 s worked 2 part-time jobs , and sometimes 3 , each semester .\nWhen classes were over , she found a paid internship in her field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , she was able to reapply for it for a second summer .\nBecause of her efforts , she 's going to graduate on time and , God willing , debt-free .\nI 'll hope that Ronan 's little brother , who 's looking at several options post-high school graduation , will be able to find the same opportunities .\nFor those kids who may not be heading straight to college , or who find themselves on a different path altogether , I hope that they are met

president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and director of its Global Health Policy Center '' .\nMorrison 's article is interesting both because it discloses explicitly how 9/11 was made an opportunity to draw health into the global security agenda of the United States while failing to understand how such a move might result in the shattering of `` consensus '' and the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : `` smart power '' even if it is smart is not `` liberal '' and will not lead to consensus .\nBut it also spells out that the global vaccine program has become a covert instrument of US power .\nIf Morrison by any chance laments the passing of the centre-left government in Italy , then perhaps the White House putting Italy and its health minister , Beatrice Lorenzin , in charge of global vaccine strategy was an error Morrison thinks it is a paradox but it is scarcely so if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures over its citizens at the behest of a foreign power - even those who favor vaccination could be concerned at the state 's new found powers over their bodies ( which might also be indefinitely extended ) .\nIf that was not so smart a political move perhaps the technology is not so smart either - as I remarked to Steven Salzberg a few years ago : `` The unwelcome news is that the \u201c cruise missiles and drone helicopters \u201d of the war on disease often hit the wrong target , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopters you unleash the greater the risk '' .\nFrankly , no one knows what they are going to be injected with next .\nSmart bombs become too easily the agents of international chaos and mistrust : just so the smart bombs of the war on disease , both for what they can do to your body and what they can do the political landscape , including destabilizing friendly governments .\n\u201c Smart power \u201d is also duplicitous : Italy is just the surrogate of the US .\nWhy could the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of Obama saying in effect your bodies

could we be further from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuremberg Code 70 years ago .\nEverything we have learnt has been stood on its head .\nBelow is a letter I recently wrote to British Medical Journal (

campaigns in the world over the next five years .\nThis was decided by the Global Health Security Agenda ( GHSA ) held last Friday at the White House .\nOur country , represented by the Minister of

''\nCitizens may also have been sceptical of Lorenzin 's claim that 270 children had died in a recent outbreak of measles in London [ 3,4 ] , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mandated to protect against one disease .\nIt is interesting in this light to view the complaint of J Stephen Morrison ( senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and director of its Global Health Policy Center ) in BMJ Opinion that post-war consensus has broken down [ 5 ] : '' Global health is a product of the Western postwar liberal international order\u2014an order that is today besieged , says Stephen Morrison '' '' In the past two decades , we have witnessed an expansion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted in humanitarianism , the rule of law , and democracy .\nUnderlying this action have been the principles of multilateralism , alliances , and partnerships .\nIt has been consistently argued that investments outside home borders will not only save and improve lives but also promote economic growth and the stability of communities .\n`` In surprising and unforeseen ways , global health also benefited enormously from the post 9/11 counter terror doctrine that came to dominate the security strategies of the major Western powers .\nThat doctrine aggressively advanced the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats .\nIt put a spotlight on smaller countries beset by weaker governance and fragile infrastructure , where grave health challenges can fuel armed , internal violence .\nCounter terror gave rise to the belief that focused investments\u2014 \u201c smart power \u201d \u2014would achieve concrete results in improving lives while also winning hearts and minds in a global struggle . ''\nBut there is a paradox here that `` smart power '' is necessarily what everyone wants , or that the consensus is any longer `` liberal '' .\nThe Italian people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cede rights over their bodies and those of their children to the state because of the demands of global security strategy ( starting apparently in the White House ) .\nEven if they accepted ten vaccines where would this end in principle ?\nCould it be that the global strategists are themselves smashing the consensus , by arrogating extraordinary rights over ordinary people ?\nMorrison assumes this is a benefit of 9/11 , but if so it was not one that the citizens of the world were consulted about , it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we were all just supposed to do as we were told .\n[ 2 ] John Stone , 'Re : MEPs devise strategy to tackle vaccine hesitancy among public -Echoes of WMD ' , 26 March 2018 , https : //www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.k1378/rr John Stone is UK and European editor of Age of Autism Click through the covers to read more & choose your format .\nYour purchase helps support our mission .\nThank you .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/713074838/0/ageofautism.html", "published": "2022-09-26T01:00:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1664168400, "collection_utc": 1664186528}, {"id": "ageofautism--2022-09-26--Suggested Reading", "date": "2022-09-26", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "Suggested Reading", "content": "Click through the covers to read more & place an order .\nYour purchase helps support our mission .\nThank @ @ @ @ @ have not completely disappeared , the gas engine of the reading world .\nRead .\n@ @ @ @ @ you .", "author": "Age of Autism", "url": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/713074840/0/ageofautism.html", "published": "2022-09-26T00:59:00-04:00", "published_utc": 1664168340, "collection_utc": 1664186528}, {"id": "ageofautism--2022-09-27--When Treatment Is Shunned", "date": "2022-09-27", "source": "ageofautism", "title": "When Treatment Is Shunned", "content": "Cure has been a dirty word in autism for decades .\nWe 've been carefully taught that there is no cure for autism .\nTreatments are only therapeutic and rarely medical .\nAnd to want a cure is to hate your child .\nWe 've seen a similar conflict during the Covid years .\nIf you 're an old timer in the biomedical autism world , you 'll remember that Lupron was suggested as a treatment for high mercury to lower aggression and some of the worst autism symptoms .\nIn 2010 , Disability Scoop called it a `` Chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s more they are highlighting the risks that Lupron can bring patients including heart problems , stunted growth and impotence ...

chambers , \u201d Sharav said .\n\u201c It developed in phases \u2013 9 years of incremental phases during which people lost their rights \u2013 their legal rights , their civil rights , and human rights .\nIt happened in stages because Hitler wanted to see if anyone would object .\nSo the problem , really , with a holocaust , is with the onlookers who obey orders blindly and they keep escalating and escalating the human rights violations until you \u2019 ve got genocide on your hands , \u201d Sharav @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily see the control measures enacted worldwide in the behavior of the authorities in mid-1930s Nazi Germany .\n\u201c People have been programmed through an education system that teaches people to defer to authority .\nDeferring to authority and obeying what is dictated by authority , is collaborating in one \u2019 s enslavement , \u201d she said .\nPublic health officials influenced medical examiners to falsify death certificates at the behest of the CDC .\nThe new rules stated if a person tested positive for COVID-19 and died , it was classified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from traditional protocols of death determination certainly played a role in the mounting deaths being attributed to the virus rather than the true cause of death .\nThis is the type of control the authoritarians seek , through fear and propaganda , Sharav warns .\nFREEDOM , WISCONSIN , October 5 , 2022 \u2014 As was the case in World War II , a coordinated effort using physicians , nurses , scientists , and media propaganda , the world today adopted Nazi-style methods to control billions of people , according to Vera Sharav @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a concentration camp in Ukraine when she was a young girl .\nShe is a public advocate for human rights , and the founder and president of the Alliance for Human Research Protection ( AHRP ) which serves as an information resource and public interest watchdog organization whose goal is to unlock the walls of secrecy in biomedical research and bring accountability to that endeavor .\nYesterday was the start of the solemn Jewish holiday of Atonement , Yom Kippur .\nWhen Dan Olmsted was alive , we wrestled with the intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of our writing .\nToday , to do so if often met with swift reprisal .\nAt the start of the lockdown , there was worry how people with special needs would or would not be treated .\nAnd terror at the thought of our kids alone in a hospital .\nVera Sherav was herself a child doomed by Nazi Germany , and who escaped death .\nBelow is a press release from Vera and Scott Schara , co-founder and president of Our Amazing Grace \u2019 s Light Shines On , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter , Grace , a 19-year-old girl with Down Syndrome who lost her life at the hands of medical personnel at St. Elizabeth \u2019 s Hospital ( Ascension ) in Appleton , Wis. , on Oct. 13 , 2021 .\nTwo people of deep faith .\nDifferent .\nAnd yet , joined by a common decency and urgency .\nShalom .\nOver the last three months , Sharav has joined forces with Scott Schara , co-founder and president of Our Amazing Grace \u2019 s Light Shines On , Inc. , an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace , a 19-year-old girl with Down Syndrome who lost her life at the hands of medical personnel at St. Elizabeth \u2019 s Hospital ( Ascension ) in Appleton , Wis. , on Oct. 13 , 2021 , to warn people of the coming atrocities .\nDespite their stories being than 70 years apart , they share a significant bond in their desire to prevent others from having to undertake what they \u2019 ve lived through .\n\u201c The story of the Holocaust is such a parallel because Grace was in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken out , \u201d Schara said .\n\u201c What \u2019 s different this time is they \u2019 ve been setting this up for a lot longer .\nThey took the lessons learned from the failures of the Nazis during the Holocaust and corrected them to ensure more people would die .\nGod tells us to be fruitful and multiply , but the world tells us we have too many people and population reduction is urgent .\nWhat better way to reduce the population than to use scientists and doctors to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withholding of beneficial medicines such as hydroxychloroquine , ivermectin and budesonide meant a guaranteed rise in deaths simply from doctors choosing not to do anything for a patient , other than make him go home until he got worse , at which point the hospital could feign justification for ventilator use , ICU-designation and expensive , toxic drugs in remdesivir ( $ 3,000/dose ) and tocilizumab ( $ 22,000/dose ) that showed harm to patients in clinical trials .\nAll in all , a COVID-designated ICU patient can create upwards of $ 400,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient dies , the hospital , preposterously , gets an additional $ 13,000 bonus .\n\u201c People always seem to focus on money , which is an easy tie into the comparison .\nThey can \u2019 t comprehend money drives everything and evil drives money , \u201d Schara said .\n\u201c If you look at the fact that 67 percent of kids with Down Syndrome in the United States are already murdered before they \u2019 re born \u2013 that \u2019 s called the \u2018 banality of evil , \u2019 which means evil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .\nAborting Down Syndrome children is the standard of care \u2013 that \u2019 s completely evil .\nThe government is paying hospitals bonus money to facilitate an evil agenda .\nThink about these medical personnel who were taking care of Grace .\nThey never would have even had her , so of course they viewed her as a \u2018 worthless eater.\n\u2019 \u201d That term was used in Nazi Germany under the T-4 euthanasia program that attempted to eliminate the disabled from society .\nThe belief was the country shouldn \u2019 t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t produce , so doctors made the choice to kill off those with special needs and physical disabilities starting with German children under the age of 3 , then went onto the older disabled children , to the mentally ill entirely , and then to the nursing homes , said Sharav .\n\u201c The disabled are dying in hospitals at an 11-times greater rate than the normal population , \u201d said Schara , citing research out of the U.K. he found as he began connecting the dots as to why he believes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s about is eugenics , where people are categorized according to their value to society .\nWho decides who \u2019 s valuable and who \u2019 s not valuable ?\nOnce you do that , you open the gates of Hell , \u201d Sharav said .\n\u201c And with COVID , what happened early on , in March and April of 2020 , was the governments across western Europe , United States , Canada , Australia and others issued orders to hospitals to not treat the elderly .\nAs a result , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s story is appropriate in this context to show that history is repeating itself , she said .\nBoth Sharav and Schara believe the way to end this current genocide is through mass noncompliance and questioning authority , neither of which happened during the Holocaust .\n\u201c God does not want us to obey Satanic laws and mandates designed to control us .\nHe will provide the strength to resist , \u201d Schara said .\nTheir two organizations collaborated on a short , animated video to get their message out to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they \u2019 re doing together because they see it \u2019 s helping wake people up .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve had people tell me they felt like something was wrong throughout COVID , that things just didn \u2019 t match up .\nLooking at it through this lens of history is what made them realize their intuition was spot on .\nWe have to keep spreading the word and continue to save lives , \u201d Schara said .\n\u201c The first step to waking up is to realize you \u2019 ve been programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues to book interviews .\nContact Kevin Tuttle at kevin @ ouramazinggrace.net to reserve a time .",

day , I saw the boy again .\n\u201c Hey there !\n\u201d I happily greeted him .\nHis greeting had a different emotion than mine .\n\u201c I feel bad for Ronan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nCompletely taken by surprise , I said , \u201c Oh !\nWhy , buddy ?\n\u201d I had spared him lots of details , like that we saw Ronan decline most after vaccinations , but I could tell what little I did share the day before had really affected him .\n\u201c Well , he\u2026 \u201d the boy started , \u201c \u2026he can \u2019 t talk and do things by himself .\nWhat if he wants to tell you something ?\n\u201d I told him , \u201c You \u2019 re right .\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but remember when I said Ronan can communicate ?\nI shared that he can type , and he can use sign language , and he can write with a pencil , and he can show us things that he wants.\n\u201d Quietly , the boy nodded his head and said , \u201c Y-e-s , I remember.\n\u201d Still , the boy \u2019 s eyes told me that he was quite moved knowing that my son couldn \u2019 t do things the boy could easily do .\nMy next words needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty happy kid .\nWe keep him safe and as healthy as we can .\nWhen Ronan pops into your mind , like it did just now , maybe you can say a little prayer for him .\nOr maybe you can say a little prayer for the person who \u2019 s helping him .\nWhen you see me without Ronan , it \u2019 s because he \u2019 s being taken care of by someone else .\nIt would be so neat if you could say a little prayer and ask God to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It \u2019 s because of our helpers that we \u2019 ve been able to keep Ronan happy and healthy , too , and I \u2019 m so grateful for them.\n\u201d It was a big ask , but the little boy said he could say a prayer .\nKnowing I \u2019 d captured his full attention , I continued , \u201c And maybe you can add a thankful prayer for what you get to do , too .\nYou get to do lots of pretty neat things , don \u2019 t you ?\n@ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play with friends , and go outside and explore new places .\nDon \u2019 t feel bad that Ronan can \u2019 t do that stuff , but be thankful that you can do what you want to .\nI think that it \u2019 s a really good thing that you \u2019 re able to things.\n\u201d Without saying anything , he nodded .\nThen as quietly as he had approached me , he turned to walk away and said , \u201c Okay\u2026bye , Mrs. Jameson.\n\u201d I thought I sounded convincing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn this kid \u2019 s frown upside down .\nI \u2019 ll look forward to our next meet up .\nI \u2019 ll wonder if the boy will tell me that he thought to pray for my son .\nI \u2019 ll hope that he \u2019 ll share that he \u2019 s gotten to do something amazing .\nI \u2019 ll also say a little prayer myself .\nI \u2019 ll pray that he \u2019 s one of

We are not good at detection/stratification and therefore have not developed and tested therapies for well\u2010defined types of myocarditis ; we do not have good treatments , and therefore do not routinely pursue more granular diagnoses .\nNotably , although cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging has transformed our ability to detect acute myocardial inflammation , CMR and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effector mechanisms , and have poor sensitivity for differentiating chronic progressive disease from noninflammatory cardiomyopathies.3 Moving Forward : Cutting the Knot To move beyond this impasse requires us to address the \u201d scanty understanding of root causes and effector mechanisms \u201d as they relate to \u201c different types of acute and chronic \u201d myocarditis .\nFor example , although viral agents ( most commonly viruses ) are often causally implicated , there are noninfectious causes ( toxins , drugs , malignancy , autoimmunity , RNA vaccines , etc . )\nas well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies supply substantial evidence that , in susceptible hosts , acute and/or chronic heart\u2010specific autoimmunity can be triggered by self\u2010limiting viral infections.4 Infection is not necessary for this , however : heart\u2010specific autoimmunity can develop when myocardial antigens are presented to the immune system in an appropriate place and inflammatory context ( eg , inoculation of susceptible mouse strains with myosin heavy chain plus vaccine adjuvant ) .\nThis gives rise to an intriguing hypothesis that other causes of acute , chronic , or recurrent myocardial injury can promote cardiac autoimmunity in susceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct inflammatory mechanisms could co\u2010exist , interact , and why they can be difficult to separate out , it may help to consider what we know of myocardial inflammation caused by or following COVID\u201019 infections .\nData suggest that forms of myocarditis can result from the following : myocellular lysis from replicating virions ; myocardial injury secondary to systemic hyperinflation ; adaptive immune responses targeting infected cells ( lymphocytic infiltrates are typical here ) ; and postinfectious Multi\u2010System Inflammatory Syndrome.6 , 7 , 8 To belabor the point : in otherwise apparently similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may detect evidence of viral infection , but frequently fails to do so .\nHistology commonly identifies CD3+ lymphocytes , but eosinophilic , granulomatous , giant\u2010cell , and mixed infiltrates are detected in others cases of \u201d myocarditis , \u201d each of which is associated with different outcomes.2 , 9 Humoral responses to virus and/or self may also be important , resulting in antibody\u2010mediated myocardial injury as well as effects resulting from agonist/antagonist activity if/when receptor epitopes are targeted.2 These diversions , which seek to emphasize heterogeneity in cause and effect , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppress persistent inflammation , a mechanistic \u201c dichotomy \u201d ( between immunologically mediated myocardial injury that targets viral antigen on chronically infected heart cells , and immunologically mediated myocardial injury directed against self\u2010antigens ) is of key importance .\nNotably , as suggested below , this dichotomy alongside the other limitations described above , are considerably less relevant when considering postvaccine myocarditis from a purely clinical perspective .\nDetection , Defining , and Management of Postvaccine Myocarditis Sandeep et al.1 adopt a pragmatic approach to the detection and management of postvaccine myocarditis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered a 3\u2010part pathway .\nFirst , the approach to detection and diagnosis assesses the probability that a presentation with acute myocardial injury is causally related to recent vaccination .\nDiagnosis is considerably more straightforward than in other settings where myocarditis might be suspected , because most presentations currently confer a high pretest probability .\nA unique combination of typical features currently characterizes the vast majority of cases of postvaccine myocarditis : near identical , easily \u201d detected \u201d pathogenetic agents ; typical temporal features ; and similar clinical features typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and troponin elevation .\nClinical presentations share yet other strikingly similar features , including sex ( overwhelmingly male ) , young age ( more clearly defined when adult cases are studied ) , when vaccine exposure occurred ( within 5 days of a second mRNA vaccine is typical ; intriguingly , some data infer that presentations after the first dose can develop if infection with COVID\u201019 acts as the first \u201d vaccine \u201d 10 ) , and medium\u2010term outcomes appear to be overwhelmingly benign.10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute myocardial injury also receive due attention in this part of the pathway ; these alternative causes include other forms of myocarditis .\nIn fact , postvaccine myocarditis strongly resembles a form of acute myocarditis that commonly presents on acute coronary syndrome pathways with cardiac symptoms ( usually cardiac chest pain ) , ECG abnormalities , troponin elevation , and unobstructed arteries.16 Often referred to as \u201c acute coronary syndrome\u2013 like \u201d myocarditis , presentations often follow on the heels of symptoms of a mild resolving/resolved viral infection , and young male adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be asked whether both phenomena are similar forms of \u201d triggered , self\u2010limiting , acute autoimmune myocarditis.\n\u201d READ MORE HERE .\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors .\nPublished on behalf of the American Heart Association , Inc. , by Wiley

harm.\n\u201d To this expedient end , the FDA allowed Pfizer to \u201c stop the [ RSV ] study short , \u201d halting enrollment at about 7,400 participants \u2014 though the trial was supposed to involve 10,000 pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been busy handing out \u201c Breakthrough Therapy \u201d designations to Pfizer as if they were papal dispensations , signaling a regulatory willingness to

in 4 pregnant women in the U.S. took them \u2014 Pfizer is hoping to hit another home run with the RSV vaccine .\nNot coincidentally , RSV is the latest viral bugaboo to hit the headlines , with frantic news accounts of \u201c overwhelmed \u201d hospitals sounding eerily reminiscent of the early coronavirus fear-mongering .\nOn Nov. 1 , Pfizer issued a press release about an investigational vaccine for pregnant women the company said will protect babies from respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .\nBuoyed by the successful global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is teeing up to dominate the maternal vaccine market even as OB-GYNs on the front lines of maternal care sound the alarm about the COVID-19 shots \u2019 infanticidal fallout .\nMy daughters were born between '94 and 2000 .\nI was forbidden so much as an aspirin by my doctor .\nI used to avoid the lunchroom at my office when the microwave was in use .\nAnyone remember the Safeminds campaign to stop flu vaccines in pregnant women a dozen years ago ?\nThe Defender from Children 's Health Defense has stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one below on Pfizer 's voracious greed targeting pregnant women .\nWe are a content sharing partner with CHD .\nIn fact , the influenza and Tdap ( tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis ) vaccines that public health agencies have long recommended for pregnant women never underwent any clinical trial safety testing in that population , and the FDA never licensed those vaccines specifically for pregnant women .\nMoreover , flu shots and Tdap shots have never even resulted in any statistically significant reduction in the outcomes they are supposed to address .\nWith the advent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FDA , Pfizer and other manufacturers barely made any pretense of assessing maternal safety , and likely \u201c colluded together to conceal damaging data \u201d about high rates of fetal death .\nOther researchers , however \u2014 and even vaccine insiders \u2014 began to speak out in 2021 .\nFor example , Canadian researchers writing in late 2021 worried that many of the systemic reactions commonly reported after COVID-19 vaccination might be \u201c sufficient to affect fetal/neonatal development.\n\u201d Those authors included vaccinologist Byram Bridle , Ph.D. , who earlier in 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accumulation in vital organs as \u201c a big mistake , \u201d and neurology professor Dr. Steven Pelech , who expressed repeated concerns about myocarditis and the vaccines \u2019 risks to young people .\nNow , as horrified pregnant women who took the COVID-19 jabs experience skyrocketing miscarriages , stillbirths and fetal malformations , they are wondering why regulators issued no warnings .\nBut as Pfizer \u2019 s exuberant RSV press release and the FDA \u2019 s complacent endorsement of clinical trial shortcuts suggest , vaccine makers and regulators not only intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety signals but are clearly positioning themselves to go after pregnant women in an even bigger way .\nThe details provided \u2014 or omitted \u2014 about Pfizer \u2019 s RSV clinical trial exemplify manufacturers \u2019 and regulators \u2019 cavalier approach toward pregnant women .\nCommenting on Pfizer \u2019 s announcement , family physician Dr. Buzz Hollander \u2014 who clarified that he is predisposed to celebrate the new RSV vaccine offering \u2014 nonetheless noted a number of serious criticisms : \u2022 Pfizer released \u201c just a press release \u201d but no data , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine \u2019 s declared efficacy ] apart.\n\u201d \u2022 Pfizer offered no explanation as to how it defined \u201c severe \u201d disease , its primary endpoint .\n\u2022 A year into the trial , Pfizer fishily altered an important endpoint , defying a fundamental clinical trial design principle that \u201c involves setting out in advance the endpoints that will be assessed.\n\u201d \u2022 In Hollander \u2019 s words , Pfizer \u201c switched their secondary ( critical ! )\nendpoint of RSV hospitalizations to 360 days from 180 days\u2026 and then inspired my suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interim or otherwise , in their breathless press release.\n\u201d \u2022 Researchers have published only one small safety study for the RSV shot , about which Hollander said : \u201c I quibble with studies finding > 40 % of placebo participants reporting systemic symptoms ; when queried enticingly enough , half of us might recall a headache or some fatigue the day after our placebo shot , and that can bury a difference in real adverse reactions compared to the vaccine group.\n\u201d \u2022 Curtailing study enrollment was unwise , Hollander said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to \u2026 finding safety signals.\n\u201d \u2022 Earlier this year , GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) \u201c stopped cold \u201d a three-times-bigger trial of a similar RSV vaccine for pregnant women after detecting a safety signal , yet there has been no discussion as to why Pfizer \u2019 s maternal RSV vaccine is \u201c fine \u201d while GSK \u2019 s was deemed \u201c untouchable.\n\u201d Hollander \u2019 s modest conclusion : \u201c We should have all learned by now that even the appearance of cutting corners in the vaccine approval process will carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hollander \u2019 s post were less circumspect .\nOne acerbically remarked , \u201c The problem here is Pfizer .\nThey \u2019 ve paid billions in fines for shady practices and data manipulation .\nAnd that was before the Covid vaccines ( for which they \u2019 re indemnified ) .\n\u201d Another reader expressed his reservations even more succinctly : \u201c Trust Pfizer numbers ?\nYou must be joking.\n\u201d As Pfizer , with the FDA \u2019 s help , tees itself up to \u201c dominat [ e ] the maternal RSV vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of maternal care are stepping forth to sound the alarm about the COVID-19 shots \u2019 infanticidal fallout .\nDr. Kimberly Biss recently tweeted , \u201c Since the vaccine rollout started , we have seen in our practice a decrease in new OB numbers , which would be infertility , by about 50 % ; we \u2019 ve also seen an increase in miscarriage rate by about 50 % , and \u2026 probably about a 25 % increase in abnormal pap smears as well as cervical malignancies.\n\u201d Similarly , Dr. James Thorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u201c off-the-charts \u201d rise in sudden fetal death and other adverse outcomes , including fetal malformation and fetal cardiac arrest .\nAsked to comment on information recently leaked from a California hospital , Thorp characterized the uptick in fetal deaths \u2014 from under 6 per 1,000 in 2020 to more than 29 per 1,000 following the rollout of COVID-19 injections \u2014 as being \u201c way way beyond \u201d what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordinarily would consider a safety signal .\nThorp published a preprint in September ( along with co-authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 s Megan Redshaw ) describing \u201c significantly more frequent \u201d pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , or VAERS , after COVID-19 shots than in the aftermath of flu shots \u2014 which themselves are far from benign .\nCataloging significant increases in \u201c miscarriage , fetal chromosomal abnormalities , fetal malformation , fetal cystic hygroma , fetal cardiac disorders , fetal arrhythmia , fetal cardiac arrest , fetal vascular mal-perfusion , fetal growth abnormalities , fetal abnormal surveillance , fetal placental thrombosis , low amniotic fluid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormalities , Thorp and co-authors called for a \u201c worldwide moratorium on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy.\n\u201d For children who survive , Thorp suggested they may suffer from lifelong \u201c vaccine-induced acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\n\u201d In Scotland , meanwhile , the government ordered an investigation into the \u201c spike in newborn baby deaths \u201d in 2021 and 2022 , an increase \u201c larger than expected from chance alone.\n\u201d Even in a gerrymandered study clearly designed to exonerate the COVID-19 shots during pregnancy \u2014 focusing on immediate reactions after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by \u201c limited perinatal outcome assessment \u201d \u2014 researchers found that 4.4-7.5 % of pregnant women reported obstetrical symptoms .\nAs Substack writer Etana Hecht wrote last May , \u201c The topic of pregnant and nursing moms getting vaccinated under encouragement and coercion is painful , \u201d particularly once one becomes aware of \u201c how carelessly the most precious among us are being treated.\n\u201d That carelessness is evident as we witness some of the same players involved in the COVID-19 vaccine fiasco now circling back around to help build the case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes figures such as Dr. Robert Frenck , the Pfizer-beholden principal investigator of the Cincinnati Children \u2019 s Hospital clinical trial that tested the company \u2019 s COVID-19 shot in children .\nFrenck reported 12-year-old Maddie de Garay \u2019 s serious vaccine injuries to the FDA as a mere \u201c stomachache.\n\u201d Graphs clearly show that none of the vaccines pushed on pregnant women are safe for babies or moms \u2014 but given that from one-fourth to one-half of pregnant women acquiesce to getting them , those who

is clear and compelling evidence of cheating and lying with the vaccines on the CDC schedule for children .\nIt was written , first and foremost , for parents and future parents .\nIt is also a great resource for all others who want to know the truth about vaccines .\nIn the introduction on page 29 , the authors state : \u201c If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to gather the courage required for a journey to the other side of reality , courage to face new facts and examine them objectively , courage to ask hard questions when you are expected to merely obey , and courage to stand your ground in the

is a lot of money on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclude that new vaccines are safe regardless of the facts .\nWhat Is the Takeaway for Chapter One ?\nA summary of chapter one appears on pages 81 and 82 : \u201c Vaccine trials are designed and performed in such a way as to ensure that the true extent of adverse events is hidden from the public .\nThere is not a single vaccine in the U.S. routine childhood vaccination program whose true rate of adverse events is known .\nThe assertion that vaccines cause serious side effects in \u201c one in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous clinical trials in which serious adverse events were reported in 1 in 40 , 30 , or even as few as 20 vaccinated infants.\n\u201d VAERS is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System .\nWhy does it pick up only between 1 and 10 percent of vaccine injuries ?\nOne reason is that most parents are completely unaware that they can report their child \u2019 s post-vaccination adverse health events directly .\nAnother reason is that medical professionals only report a tiny fraction of vaccine injuries and there is no consequence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , a system was developed by researcher Ross Lazarus and his team that would automatically indicate a likely vaccine injury .\nThis system would identify a much larger percent of vaccine injuries .\nThe CDC rejected this more efficient system .\nWho benefits when only a small percentage of vaccine injuries and deaths are reported ?\nThe current system only helps perpetuate the false narrative that vaccine adverse events are very rare .\nThe authors comment on page 125 : \u201c Health authorities appear quite comfortable with deficient and unreliable-by-design reporting systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to challenge their \u201c Vaccines are safe \u201d message , as exemplified by the CDC inexplicably blocking a government-funded project to improve VAERS.\n\u201d The CDC does not want VAERS to be more efficient at detecting vaccine injuries and deaths .\nRemember regulatory capture .\nAt the beginning of chapter 5 , the authors state : \u201c In this chapter we will look at how medical and scientific bodies make use of biased epidemiological research to present an illusion of vaccine safety to the public \u2026 a coherent picture emerges of a deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex of misleading scientific research designed to cover up the truth about vaccine safety.\n\u201d On pages 162-199 , the authors provide a detailed analysis of five \u201c doctored \u201d vaccine studies .\nThe details of these studies are too voluminous to be included in this article but interested readers are encouraged to read about these studies to see how biased and dishonest vaccine science can be .\nThe authors describe these studies as deeply flawed , misleading science that serves the vested interests of the funders of the medical journals ( big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the truth .\nOn pages 191-192 , they state : \u201c The obvious question , then , is how did this quintet of purposely flawed studies ever make it through that rigorous screening process [ peer review ] ?\nWhy and how did prestigious journals such as NEJM [ New England Journal of Medicine ] and Pediatrics print studies with such glaring faults ?\nWhy would leading medical journals put their hard-earned reputations at risk by publishing flawed research ?\n\u201d Part of the answer is that big pharma is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .\nIs this not cheating and lying ?\nWhy are Epidemiological Studies So Popular ?\nIn the summary of chapter 5 on pages 198 and 199 , the authors answer this question : \u201c Epidemiological studies are the tool of choice for health authorities and pharma companies to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of vaccine safety science .\nThey are cheap , relatively simple to conduct , and , above all , their results are easily manipulated \u2026 Would you expect pharmaceutical companies and government agencies to fund vaccine safety studies that could potentially find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , license , and recommend to the public ?\n\u201d Studies That the CDC and Big Pharma Will Never Fund Vaccinated versus unvaccinated studies ( VU studies ) will apparently never be funded despite parents demanding these studies for more than 30 years .\nImagine a large study which compared fully vaccinated children with never vaccinated children .\nWhy are such studies avoided like the plague ?\nAnswer : The results would show that completely unvaccinated children are far healthier than fully vaccinated children .\nOn page 206 and 207 , the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health impact of routinely administering an ever-increasing number of vaccines to American infants has never been studied .\nIn other words , the fundamental question that bothers every vaccine-informed parent \u2013 \u201c Will my child be better off fully vaccinated , partially vaccinated , or unvaccinated ?\n\u201d \u2013 has never been adequately answered by science .\nNo study that compares the overall health of vaccinated children to that of unvaccinated children has ever been done by the medical establishment.\n\u201d [ A few VU studies not mentioned in this book have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific journals .\nIf you click this link : Article 1 , you will be instantly teleported through a black hole to my article titled \u201c Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier \u201d .\nYou will see that the unvaccinated children in these studies are substantially healthier than the vaccinated children .\nEnjoy . ]\nIf the authorities who control money for vaccine research wanted to settle the \u201c vaccines cause autism \u201d accusation , they would fund a VU study .\nWhich group would have a much higher rate of autism ?\nOn page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of autism research : \u201c Over the past 15 years , dozens of epidemiological studies have been conducted examining the association between vaccines and autism , but not even one compared the rate of autism in fully vaccinated versus fully unvaccinated children .\nDespite the fact that autism has become a huge social and financial burden on American society , the U.S. medical establishment has stubbornly rejected every opportunity to dive deeper into its root causes by investigating the rates of autism in unvaccinated populations.\n\u201d Here are a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated : ( 1 ) In 2005 , Dan Olmsted discovered that the large Amish population in Lancaster County , Pennsylvania had a strikingly low rate of autism .\nThey also had a low rate of vaccination .\nThis was an excellent opportunity to investigate the causes of autism , but the authorities looked the other way .\n( 2 ) Olmsted also investigated the Homefirst clinic of Dr. Mayer Eisenstein and colleagues near Chicago .\nThey did home births and many of their patients choose to avoid vaccines .\nThese doctors said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thousands of unvaccinated children they \u2019 d had under their care over more than 30 years .\nThis is another situation that cries out to be investigated , but the CDC did nothing .\n( 3 ) In 2004 , the Ruppin Academic Center in Israel compared the rate of autism among Israeli children of Ethiopian descent born in Ethiopia with those born in Israel .\nThe children born in Israel had an autism rate equal to the Israeli national rate while those born in Ethiopia had an autism rate of zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar to the U.S. schedule .\nIt is not surprising that the Ruppin study was not investigated .\n( 4 ) In 2008 , there were news stories reporting a high rate of autism in children of Somali descent born in Minnesota .\nThe rate of autism in the children born in Somalia who got far fewer vaccines was zero .\nAgain , no investigation .\nAnother missed opportunity to do a naturally occurring vaccinated/unvaccinated autism study .\nThe authors discuss these cases on pages 209 through 213 .\nThere are lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be done but the authors disagree .\nLess than one percent of children born in the U.S. are completely unvaccinated but that still adds up to at least 30,000 unvaccinated children born each year .\nMany of their parents would be happy for these children to be the unvaccinated part of a VU study .\nVU Studies Have Most Likely Been Done Then Buried The authors speculate on this possibility on page 233 : \u201c If these internal VU studies were indeed quietly performed , as seems very likely , why weren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be only one explanation : The results were markedly in favor of the unvaccinated \u2026 If those informal VU studies showed a positive result for vaccines , they would have been published faster than you can say \u201c vaccines are safe and effective !\n\u201d \u2013 no doubt about it.\n\u201d More and More Vaccines \u00e0 More and More Chronic Diseases On page 206 , the authors point out : \u201c \u2026No VU studies have been conducted for cancer , asthma , diabetes , learning disorders , ADHD , Crohn \u2019 s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although all of them have become increasingly common in recent decades.\n\u201d [ If you click this link : Article 2 , you will be beamed up to my article titled \u201c Chronic Diseases in Vaccinated Versus Unvaccinated \u201d to see the results of a pilot study which shows much higher rates of chronic diseases in vaccinated children and adults compared to an unvaccinated control group . ]\nDid Vaccines Save Us All from Deadly Infectious Diseases ?\nOn page 267 , the authors address this widely believed misconception : \u201c The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadly diseases of yore is deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness \u2026 Everyone knows we have the medical profession and vaccines to thank for our ( relatively ) disease-less lives \u2026 Unfortunately , everyone is wrong \u2026 Historical evidence uncovered in the second half of the 20th century shows , clearly and unequivocally , that the narrative of \u201c life-saving vaccines \u201d is largely fictitious.\n\u201d For example , mortality from measles dropped almost 99 % before the measles vaccine was introduced .\nThe authors point out on page 270 : \u201c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious disease mortality among U.S. children occurred before 1940 when few antibiotics or vaccines were available.\n\u201d So , what did cause this drastic decrease in infectious disease mortality if it wasn \u2019 t vaccines and antibiotics ?\nSanitation in many forms and improved nutrition are the real heroes that deserve credit for most of the decrease in infectious disease mortality .\nThe authors sum this up on page 306 : \u201c Although they are well aware that the bulk of the reduction in the burden of infectious disease can not be attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and rock-solid scientific evidence have proven that fact , health authorities around the world continue to promote the largely false \u201c vaccines eradicated the great diseases of yore \u201d myth.\n\u201d Let \u2019 s end with this quote on page 509-510 : \u201c \u2026One must inevitably conclude that all parties involved are engaged in deliberate and systematic efforts to hide the painful , astonishing , and earth-shattering truth regarding the \u201c safety \u201d of vaccines from the public.\n\u201d Dr. Gaunt \u2019 s conclusion : Many chronic diseases are being caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine

!\nPlease read , click over and comment to Jeremy on his site .\n# # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ \u2019 t Cause Autism \u2019 Is Disinformation By Jeremy Hammond \u201c Vaccines do not cause autism.\n\u201d That is what we are continually told by government health officials , the mainstream media , and the pharma-centric medical establishment .\nIt is the official position of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .\nThe idea that vaccines can cause autism is just misinformation spread by \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d , we are told ; it is a claim that has been repeatedly debunked by scientific research .\nBut has it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derogatory label \u201c anti-vaxxer \u201d being slung at them since they did vaccinate their children only to witness them being injured and , in some cases , developmentally regressing into autism .\nThe concern that many parents have today is that vaccinating children according to the CDC \u2019 s routine childhood schedule can contribute to the development of autism in children with a genetic or environmentally caused susceptibility .\nTo state that \u201c vaccines do not cause autism \u201d is to claim that scientific research has falsified that hypothesis .\nBut that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has not been falsified by the scientific research conducted to date .\nThis can be demonstrated by examining the CDC \u2019 s own cited sources .\nThe mainstream media , for their part , uncritically parrot the official position of the so-called \u201c public health \u201d establishment , thus serving to propagate official disinformation under the false pretext of combatting \u201c misinformation \u201d from \u201c anti-vaxxers \u201d .\nOne illustrative example of this that I \u2019 ve recently encountered is a CNET article by science editor Jackson Ryan titled \u201c Meta Trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It Was Shut Down After 2 Days \u201d .\nThe article , published on November 20 , 2022 , is about a search engine for the scientific literature built by Meta ( formerly Facebook ) that uses artificial intelligence to \u201c summarize areas of research , solve math problems and write scientific code.\n\u201d A demo launch of the tool , called Galactica , was deemed a failure due to it spewing gibberish answers to questions .\nTo illustrate , CNET provides the following example : Almost as soon as it hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of hardball scientific questions .\nOne user asked \u201c Do vaccines cause autism ?\n\u201d Galactica responded with a garbled , nonsensical response : \u201c To explain , the answer is no .\nVaccines do not cause autism .\nThe answer is yes .\nVaccines do cause autism .\nThe answer is no.\n\u201d ( For the record , vaccines don \u2019 t cause autism . )\nRyan thus claims that studies have falsified the hypothesis .\nBut is that so ?\nHe provides four sources to support that contention , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the sources and see if we find any studies that were actually designed to test the hypothesis .\nThe result of this exercise illuminates how the claim that the hypothesis has been falsified is government-sanctioned disinformation propagated for the purpose of manufacturing consent for the CDC \u2019 s policy aim of achieving high vaccine uptake .\nRead Hammond 's full article at his site .\nThe Wuhan Cover-Up pulls back the curtain on how the US government 's increase in
